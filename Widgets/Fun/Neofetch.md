## Neofetch: Display the Linux logo along with system info

The above linuxlogo command is too simplistic. You can amp it up by using Neofetch.

It displays the distribution in a more pretty way along with several system information like kernel, uptime, desktop environment, theme, icons, etc.

You can also parse it through lolcat to get rainbow-colored output.

Install Neofetch using this command:

```
sudo apt install neofetch
```

for running: 

```
neofetch
```
