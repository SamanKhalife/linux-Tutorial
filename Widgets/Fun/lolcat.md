## Add colors to your terminal

Still, I included it at the beginning of this article because you can combine other ASCII tools with lolcat.

So, what does it do? It is similar to the cat command but it adds random gradient colors to its output.

It may not look useful at the moment but youâ€™ll see its impact when the outputs of other ASCII tools are piped through lolcat.

Install lolcat with the apt command:

```
sudo apt install lolcat
```
