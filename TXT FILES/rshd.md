The `rshd` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to provide remote shell access to a system. It is a simple protocol that is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers.

Instead of using the `rshd` command, you should use the `ssh` command to provide remote shell access to a system. The `ssh` command is a more secure and efficient way to provide remote shell access to a system. It is also supported by most Linux distributions.

The `ssh` command is used to log in to a remote system and execute commands. It is a versatile command that can be used to do a variety of things, including:

* Running commands on a remote system.
* Transferring files between systems.
* Managing services on a remote system.

The `ssh` command is used in the following syntax:

```
ssh [options] [username]@[hostname]
```

The `username` is the name of the user to log in as on the remote system.

The `hostname` is the name of the remote system to log in to.

For example, to log in to the system `example.com` as the user `root`, you would use the following command:

```
ssh root@example.com
```

This command will open a terminal session on the system `example.com` and you will be logged in as the user `root`.

The `ssh` command is a powerful tool that can be used to do a variety of things on remote systems. It is supported by most Linux distributions and is a secure and efficient way to provide remote shell access.

The `rshd` command is a legacy protocol that is no longer recommended for use. It is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers. Instead, you should use the `ssh` command to provide remote shell access to a system.
