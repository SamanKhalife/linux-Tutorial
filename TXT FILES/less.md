The `less` command in Linux is a pager, which is a program that allows you to view the contents of a file one screen at a time. The `less` command is a versatile tool that can be used to view text files, log files, and other types of files.

The syntax for the `less` command is as follows:

```
less [options] file
```

The `file` argument is the file that you want to view. If you do not specify a file, the `less` command will read from standard input.

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `less` command.

Here are some of the most useful `less` options:

* `-F`: Fast mode.
* `-S`: Smooth scrolling.
* `-E`: Enable line numbers.
* `-K`: Disable line numbers.
* `-R`: Reverse mode.

Here is an example of how to use the `less` command to view the contents of the file `/etc/passwd`:

```
less /etc/passwd
```

This command will view the contents of the file `/etc/passwd` one screen at a time. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the file, and the `q` key to quit.

Here is an example of how to use the `less` command to view the contents of the file `/etc/passwd` in fast mode:

```
less -F /etc/passwd
```

This command will view the contents of the file `/etc/passwd` in fast mode. This will allow you to scroll through the file much faster.

The `less` command is a versatile tool that can be used to view the contents of a variety of files. It is a valuable tool for troubleshooting problems, or for simply viewing the contents of a file.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `less` command:

* It can be used to view the contents of a file one screen at a time.
* It can be used to scroll through a file quickly.
* It can be used to search for text within a file.
* It can be used to display line numbers.
* It can be used to view files in reverse mode.

If you are working with files on Linux, you should make sure to learn how to use the `less` command. It is a valuable tool for viewing the contents of files.

                   SUMMARY OF LESS COMMANDS

      Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, N.
      Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.
      A key preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^K is ctrl-K.

  h  H                 Display this help.
  q  :q  Q  :Q  ZZ     Exit.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           MOVING

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          SEARCHING

  /pattern          *  Search forward for (N-th) matching line.
  ?pattern          *  Search backward for (N-th) matching line.

                           JUMPING

  g  <  ESC-<       *  Go to first line in file (or line N).
  G  >  ESC->       *  Go to last line in file (or line N).
  p  %              *  Go to beginning of file (or N percent into file).
  t                 *  Go to the (N-th) next tag.

  ESC-^F <c1> <c2>  *  Find close bracket <c2>.
  ESC-^B <c1> <c2>  *  Find open bracket <c1>.
        ---------------------------------------------------
        Each "find close bracket" command goes forward to the close bracket 
          matching the (N-th) open bracket in the top line.
        Each "find open bracket" command goes backward to the open bracket 
          matching the (N-th) close bracket in the bottom line.

  m<letter>            Mark the current top line with <letter>.
  M<letter>            Mark the current bottom line with <letter>.
  '<letter>            Go to a previously marked position.

  ESC-M<letter>        Clear a mark.
        ---------------------------------------------------
        A mark is any upper-case or lower-case letter.
        Certain marks are predefined:
             ^  means  beginning of the file
             $  means  end of the file

DESCRIPTION
       Less  is  a program similar to more(1), but it has many more features.  Less does not have
       to read the entire input file before starting, so with large  input  files  it  starts  up
       faster  than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so
       it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited support for  hardcopy  termi‐
       nals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are
       prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands are based on both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded  by  a  decimal  number,
       called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.

COMMANDS
       In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands for the ESCAPE key; for ex‐
       ample ESC-v means the two character sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".

       h or H Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all the  other  commands,
              remember this one.

       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F
              Scroll  forward  N  lines,  default one window (see option -z below).  If N is more
              than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.  Warning: some systems
              use ^V as a special literalization character.

       z      Like SPACE, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window size.

       ESC-SPACE
              Like  SPACE,  but  scrolls  a full screenful, even if it reaches end-of-file in the
              process.

       ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
              Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N  is
              more than the screen size.

       d or ^D
              Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If N is specified, it
              becomes the new default for subsequent d and u commands.

       b or ^B or ESC-v
              Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).  If  N  is  more
              than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.

       w      Like ESC-v, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window size.

       y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K
              Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is
              more than the screen size.  Warning: some systems use ^Y as a special  job  control
              character.

       u or ^U
              Scroll  backward  N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If N is specified,
              it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u commands.

       J      Like j, but continues to scroll beyond the end of the file.

       K or Y Like k, but continues to scroll beyond the beginning of the file.

       ESC-) or RIGHTARROW
              Scroll horizontally right N characters, default half the screen width (see  the  -#
              option).   If a number N is specified, it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW
              and LEFTARROW commands.  While the text is scrolled, it acts as though the  -S  op‐
              tion (chop lines) were in effect.

       ESC-( or LEFTARROW
              Scroll  horizontally  left  N characters, default half the screen width (see the -#
              option).  If a number N is specified, it becomes the default for future  RIGHTARROW
              and LEFTARROW commands.

       ESC-} or ^RIGHTARROW
              Scroll horizontally right to show the end of the longest displayed line.

       ESC-{ or ^LEFTARROW
              Scroll horizontally left back to the first column.

       r or ^R or ^L
              Repaint the screen.

       R      Repaint  the  screen,  discarding  any buffered input.  That is, reload the current
              file.  Useful if the file is changing while it is being viewed.

       F      Scroll forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is reached.   Normally
              this  command  would  be  used when already at the end of the file.  It is a way to
              monitor the tail of a file which is growing while it is being viewed.  (The  behav‐
              ior is similar to the "tail -f" command.)  To stop waiting for more data, enter the
              interrupt character (usually ^C).  On some systems you can also use ^X.
       ESC-F  Like F, but as soon as a line is found which matches the last search  pattern,  the
              terminal bell is rung and forward scrolling stops.

       g or < or ESC-<
              Go  to  line  N  in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).  (Warning: this may be
              slow if N is large.)

       G or > or ESC->
              Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.  (Warning: this may be  slow
              if  N is large, or if N is not specified and standard input, rather than a file, is
              being read.)

       ESC-G  Same as G, except if no number N is specified and the input is standard input, goes
              to the last line which is currently buffered.

       p or % Go  to  a position N percent into the file.  N should be between 0 and 100, and may
              contain a decimal point.

       P      Go to the line containing byte offset N in the file.

       {      If a left curly bracket appears in the top line displayed on the screen, the { com‐
              mand will go to the matching right curly bracket.  The matching right curly bracket
              is positioned on the bottom line of the screen.  If there is  more  than  one  left
              curly  bracket  on the top line, a number N may be used to specify the N-th bracket
              on the line.

       }      If a right curly bracket appears in the bottom line displayed on the screen, the  }
              command  will  go  to  the  matching  left  curly bracket.  The matching left curly
              bracket is positioned on the top line of the screen.  If there  is  more  than  one
              right  curly  bracket  on  the top line, a number N may be used to specify the N-th
              bracket on the line.

       (      Like {, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.

       )      Like }, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.
