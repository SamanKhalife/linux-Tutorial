# mailstats

The mailstats command in Linux is used to display statistics about the mail system. This includes information about the number of messages received, the number of messages sent, and the size of the mail queue.

The syntax for the mailstats command is as follows:

```
mailstats [options]
```

The `options` argument specifies additional options for the mailstats command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-a`: Displays all statistics.
* `-r`: Displays statistics for received messages.
* `-s`: Displays statistics for sent messages.
* `-q`: Displays statistics for the mail queue.

For example, the following command displays all statistics for the mail system:

```
mailstats -a
```

The mailstats command is a useful tool for monitoring the mail system. It can be used to identify problems with the mail system, to track the growth of the mail queue, or to plan for future mail growth.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the mailstats command:

* The mailstats command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to view mail statistics.
* The mailstats command can only be used to display statistics for the mail system on the local machine.
* The mailstats command cannot be used to display statistics for the mail system on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the mailstats command, so that you do not accidentally display information that you do not have permission to see or that is causing problems for another user.

Here are some examples of how to use the mailstats command:

* To display all statistics for the mail system:
```
mailstats -a
```
* To display statistics for received messages:
```
mailstats -r
```
* To display statistics for sent messages:
```
mailstats -s
```
* To display statistics for the mail queue:
```
mailstats -q
```
