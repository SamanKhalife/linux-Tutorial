The `dnsdomainname` command in Linux is used to display the domain name of the current host. The domain name is the part of a hostname that comes after the last dot. For example, the domain name of the host `www.example.com` is `example.com`.

The `dnsdomainname` command is used in the following syntax:

```
dnsdomainname
```

The command will print the domain name of the current host to the standard output.

For example, the following code will print the domain name of the current host:

```
dnsdomainname
```

This code will print the domain name of the current host to the standard output. If the domain name is not set, the command will print the empty string.

The `dnsdomainname` command is a simple and useful command that can be used to find the domain name of the current host. It is a valuable command to know, especially if you need to use the domain name in other commands or scripts.

Here are some additional things to note about the `dnsdomainname` command:
