## help

Usage: head \[OPTION]... \[FILE]... Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. -c, --bytes=\[-]NUM print the first NUM bytes of each file; with the leading '-', print all but the last NUM bytes of each file -n, --lines=\[-]NUM print the first NUM lines instead of the first 10; with the leading '-', print all but the last NUM lines of each file -q, --quiet, --silent never print headers giving file names -v, --verbose always print headers giving file names -z, --zero-terminated line delimiter is NUL, not newline --help display this help and exit --version output version information and exit

NUM may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000_1000, M 1024_1024, GB 1000_1000_1000, G 1024_1024_1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y. Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
