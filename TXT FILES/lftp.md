# lftp

lftp is a command-line file transfer program that allows sophisticated FTP, HTTP, and other connections to other hosts. It is designed for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It was developed by Alexander Lukyanov, and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

lftp has a number of features that make it a powerful tool for transferring files:

* It can connect to a variety of file transfer protocols, including FTP, HTTP, SFTP, and FTPS.
* It can transfer files in parallel, which can significantly improve transfer speeds.
* It can resume broken transfers, so you can pick up where you left off if the transfer is interrupted.
* It can mirror directories, which allows you to keep two directories synchronized.
* It can be used to download files from BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer networks.

lftp is a powerful and versatile tool for transferring files. It is a good choice for users who need to transfer large amounts of data or who need to transfer files between different operating systems.

Here are some examples of how to use lftp:

* To connect to an FTP server and download a file, you would use the following command:

```

```
lftp -e "mirror -r /source /destination" host1 host2
