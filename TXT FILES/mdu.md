# mdu

The `mdu` command in Linux is used to display the amount of disk space occupied by a directory, its subdirectories and files. It is similar to the `du` command on Unix.

The `mdu` command takes the following arguments:

* `directory`: The directory to list the disk usage for.
* `options`: Optional arguments that control the behavior of the `mdu` command.

The following are some of the most common options for the `mdu` command:

* `-h`: Displays sizes in human-readable format.
* `-s`: Displays total size, don't give details for each subdirectory.
* `-t`: Sorts by total size.

For example, the following command lists the disk usage for the directory `/home/user`:

```
mdu /home/user
```

The `mdu` command is a useful tool for monitoring disk usage. It can be used to identify directories or files that are taking up a lot of space, or to track the growth of disk usage over time.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `mdu` command:

* The `mdu` command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to view disk usage.
* The `mdu` command can only be used to list the disk usage for directories that are located on the local machine.
* The `mdu` command cannot be used to list the disk usage for directories that are located on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `mdu` command, so that you do not accidentally list the disk usage for a directory that you do not have permission to view or that is located on a remote machine.

Here are some examples of how to use the `mdu` command:

* To list the disk usage for the directory `/home/user` in human-readable format:
```
mdu -h /home/user
```
* To list only the total size of the directory `/home/user` and its subdirectories:
```
mdu -s /home/user
```
* To sort the output of the `mdu` command by total size:
```
mdu -t /home/user
```
