# atd
The atd command is used to start the at daemon. The at daemon is a service that allows you to schedule jobs to run at a later time.

To use the atd command, you first need to create a job file. A job file is a text file that contains the commands that you want to run at a later time.

For example, to schedule a job file called myjob.txt to run at 10:00 AM tomorrow, you would use the following command:

`at 10:00 tomorrow myjob.txt`

# help 

```
atd [options]

Start the at daemon.

Options:

-f, --foreground   Run the at daemon in the foreground.
-h, --help         Show this help message.

For more information, see the atd man page.
```
