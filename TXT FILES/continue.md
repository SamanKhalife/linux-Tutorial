The `continue` command in Linux is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and go to the next iteration. This is useful if you want to skip a certain number of iterations of a loop, or if you want to skip an iteration based on the value of a variable.

The `continue` command is used in the following syntax:

```
continue
```

The `continue` command can be used in any type of loop, including for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but will skip the numbers 5 and 6:

```
for i in {1..10}
do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ] || [ $i -eq 6 ]; then
    continue
  fi
  echo $i
done
```

This code will print the following output:

```
1
2
3
4
7
8
9
10
```

The `continue` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to skip iterations of a loop. It is a versatile command that can be used in a variety of contexts.

Here are some additional things to note about the `continue` command:

* The `continue` command can be used to skip any iteration of a loop, regardless of its type.
* The `continue` command can be used to skip an iteration based on the value of a variable.
