Autoconf is a tool that is used to generate a configure script for a source code package. The configure script is a program that is used to configure, build, and install software. Autoconf is used to generate the configure script by scanning the source code package for macros that are used by the GNU Autotools suite.

Autoconf is invoked with the following syntax:

```
autoconf [options] [directories]
```

The `directories` are the directories that contain the source code package.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-i` : Recursively autoconf all subdirectories.
* `-f` : Force autoconf to remake all files, even if they are up to date.
* `-v` : Verbose mode.

For example, to autoconf the source code package in the current directory, you would run the following command:

```
autoconf
```

This command will generate a configure script in the current directory.

To recursively autoconf all subdirectories of the current directory, you would run the following command:

```
autoconf -i
```

This command will generate a configure script in the current directory and all subdirectories.

To force autoconf to remake all files, even if they are up to date, you would run the following command:

```
autoconf -f
```

This command will force autoconf to remake all files, even if they are up to date.

To enable verbose mode, you would run the following command:

```
autoconf -v
```

This command will enable verbose mode, which will print more information about what autoconf is doing.

Autoconf is a useful tool that can be used to generate a configure script for a source code package. It can be used to fix problems with the configure script, to update the configure script to support new features, and to prepare a source code package for distribution.

Here are some additional things to note about autoconf:

* Autoconf is a part of the GNU Autotools suite.
* Autoconf is often used in conjunction with the autoscan and aclocal scripts.
* Autoconf can be used to generate a configure script for any source code package that uses the GNU Autotools suite.
* Autoconf is a safe tool to use. It will not damage any files in the source code package.
