The `pkill` command in Linux is used to send a signal to processes that match a given pattern. The signal can be used to kill, suspend, or resume processes.

The syntax for the `pkill` command is:

```
pkill [options] [pattern]
```

The `pattern` argument can be a process name, user name, or a regular expression. The `options` argument can be used to control the signal that is sent to the processes.

Some of the most useful `pkill` options include:

* `-KILL`: Send the SIGKILL signal to the processes.
* `-KILL -9`: Send the SIGKILL signal with the `-9` flag, which ensures that the processes are killed immediately.
* `-HUP`: Send the SIGHUP signal to the processes.
* `-INT`: Send the SIGINT signal to the processes.
* `-KILL -15`: Send the SIGTERM signal to the processes.

For example, to kill all processes owned by the user `root`, you would use the following command:

```
pkill -KILL -u root
```

To send the SIGHUP signal to all processes that are listening on port 80, you would use the following command:

```
pkill -HUP -f 'LISTEN 80'
```

The `pkill` command is a powerful tool for managing processes in Linux. It can be used to quickly kill processes, suspend processes, or resume processes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
