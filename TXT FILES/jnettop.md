Jnettop is a network traffic monitoring tool for Linux. It captures traffic coming across the host it is running on and displays streams sorted by bandwidth they use. This allows you to see which hosts and ports are taking up the most network bandwidth.

Here is a simple example of how to use jnettop:

```
jnettop
```

This will start jnettop and display a list of all the network streams, sorted by bandwidth. The top of the list will show the streams that are using the most bandwidth.

You can also use jnettop to filter traffic by host or port. For example, to see all the traffic to and from Google, you would use the following command:

```
jnettop -x 'host google.com'
```

To see all the traffic on port 80, you would use the following command:

```
jnettop -x 'port 80'
```

Jnettop is a powerful tool for monitoring network traffic. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems, identify bandwidth hogs, and learn more about how your network is being used.

Here are some of the features of jnettop:

* Displays network streams sorted by bandwidth
* Filters traffic by host or port
* Supports multiple interfaces
* Can be used to troubleshoot network problems
* Can be used to identify bandwidth hogs
* Can be used to learn more about how your network is being used
