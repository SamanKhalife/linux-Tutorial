The op command in Unix is used to start a process in a separate terminal. This is useful for starting processes that do not need to interact with the current terminal, or for starting processes that need to run in a separate user context.

The syntax of the op command is as follows:

```
op [options] command [arguments]
```

The `command` argument is the command that you want to start, and the `arguments` argument are the arguments that you want to pass to the command.

For example, the following command starts a bash process in a separate terminal:

```
op bash
```

To close the separate terminal, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`C`.

Here are some of the options that are available with the op command:

* `-t`: Specifies the terminal in which to start the process.
* `-u`: Specifies the user in which to start the process.
* `-g`: Specifies the group in which to start the process.
* `-S`: Specifies the terminal label.
* `-N`: Do not create a new terminal, but start the process in the current terminal.

For example, the following command starts a bash process in the terminal labeled `my-terminal`:

```
op -t my-terminal bash
```

The op command is a useful tool for starting processes in separate terminals. It can be used to start processes that do not need to interact with the current terminal, or for starting processes that need to run in a separate user context.
