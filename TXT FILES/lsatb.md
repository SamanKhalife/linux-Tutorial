# lsatb

The lsatb command in Linux is a deprecated command that is no longer supported in most modern distributions. It was used to audit the security of a Linux system.

The syntax for the lsatb command is as follows:

```
lsatb [options]
```

The `options` argument specifies additional options for the lsatb command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-a`: Performs a full audit of the system.
* `-s`: Performs a selective audit of the system.
* `-d`: Displays the results of the audit.

For example, the following command performs a full audit of the system and displays the results:

```
lsatb -a -d
```

The lsatb command is no longer supported in most modern distributions of Linux. Instead, you should use the `auditd` command to audit the security of your system. The auditd command is a more modern and feature-rich command that can be used to audit the security of your system in a more comprehensive and efficient way.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the lsatb command:

* The lsatb command is deprecated and is no longer supported in most modern distributions of Linux.
* The lsatb command can only be used to audit the security of systems that are running Linux 2.4 or later.
* The lsatb command cannot be used to audit the security of systems that are located on a different machine on the network.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the lsatb command, so that you do not accidentally use a command that is no longer supported or that cannot be used to audit the security of the systems that you need to audit.
