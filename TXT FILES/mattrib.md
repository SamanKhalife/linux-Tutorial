# mattrib

The mattrib command in Linux is used to change the attributes of MS-DOS file. It can be used to set or clear the read-only, hidden, system, and archive attributes of a file.

The mattrib command takes the following arguments:

* `filename`: The name of the file to change the attributes of.
* `options`: Optional arguments that control the behavior of the mattrib command.

The following are some of the most common options for the mattrib command:

* `+`: Sets the specified attribute.
* `-`: Clears the specified attribute.
* `r`: Sets the read-only attribute.
* `h`: Sets the hidden attribute.
* `s`: Sets the system attribute.
* `a`: Sets the archive attribute.

For example, the following command sets the read-only attribute of the file `myfile`:

```
mattrib +r myfile
```

The mattrib command is a useful tool for managing the attributes of MS-DOS files. It can be used to protect files from being modified or deleted, or to mark files as important for backup purposes.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the mattrib command:

* The mattrib command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to change the attributes of files.
* The mattrib command can only be used to change the attributes of files that are located on the local machine.
* The mattrib command cannot be used to change the attributes of files that are located on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the mattrib command, so that you do not accidentally change the attributes of a file that you do not have permission to change or that is located on a remote machine.

Here are some examples of how to use the mattrib command:

* To set the read-only attribute of the file `myfile`:
```
mattrib +r myfile
```
* To clear the read-only attribute of the file `myfile`:
```
mattrib -r myfile
```
* To set the hidden attribute of the file `myfile`:
```
mattrib +h myfile
```
* To set the system attribute of the file `myfile`:
```
mattrib +s myfile
```
* To set the archive attribute of the file `myfile`:
```
mattrib +a myfile
```
