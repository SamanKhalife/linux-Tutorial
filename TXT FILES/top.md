# 

The top command in Linux is a command-line utility that displays a real-time view of the processes running on your system. It can be used to monitor the CPU usage, memory usage, and other resources that are being used by each process.


The options argument is a list of options that you can use to customize the output of the top command.

For example, the following command will display the top 10 processes by CPU usage:

`top -n 10`

The top command is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor the performance of your system. However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can be CPU-intensive.
