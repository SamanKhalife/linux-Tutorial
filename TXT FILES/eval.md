The eval command is used to evaluate a string as a command. It is typically used to execute commands that are stored in variables or to execute commands that are passed as arguments to other commands.

For example, to evaluate the string echo "hello world", you would use the following command:

`eval echo "hello world"`

# help 

```
eval [options] [string]

Evaluate a string as a command.

Options:

-v, --verbose    Print the value of the evaluated string.
-f, --file        Treat the string as a shell script.
-r, --raw         Remove any whitespace from the string before evaluating it.
-h, --help        Show this help message.
