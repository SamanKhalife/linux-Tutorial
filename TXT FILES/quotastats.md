# quotastats

The `quotastats` command is a Linux command that is used to display statistics about disk quotas on a file system. Disk quotas are limits that can be placed on the amount of disk space that a user or group can use on a file system.

The syntax for the `quotastats` command is:

```
quotastats [options] [filesystem]
```

The options are:

* `-a` or `--all`: Displays statistics for all file systems.
* `-g` or `--group`: Displays statistics for the specified group.
* `-u` or `--user`: Displays statistics for the specified user.
* `-v` or `--verbose`: Prints verbose output.

If no options are specified, the `quotastats` command will display statistics for the default file system.

For example, to display statistics for all file systems on the system, you would use the following command:

```
quotastats -a
```

This would display statistics for all file systems, including the root file system.

To display statistics for the user `bard` on the file system `/dev/sda1`, you would use the following command:

```
quotastats -u bard /dev/sda1
```

This would display statistics for the user `bard` on the file system `/dev/sda1`.

The `quotastats` command is a useful tool for monitoring disk quotas on your system. It can be used to identify users or groups who are nearing their disk quota limits, or to identify file systems that are running out of disk space.

Here are some of the information that can be displayed by the `quotastats` command:

* The number of users and groups that have quotas set.
* The total amount of disk space that is available for quotas.
* The amount of disk space that is currently used by quotas.
* The amount of disk space that is still available for quotas.
* The number of users and groups that are nearing their disk quota limits.
* The number of file systems that are running out of disk space.

If you are using disk quotas on your system, you should make sure to use the `quotastats` command to monitor them regularly. This will help you to identify and fix problems with the disk quotas before they become a major issue.
