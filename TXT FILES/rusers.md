The `rusers` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to get information about who is logged on to a system. It is a simple protocol that is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers.

Instead of using the `rusers` command, you should use the `whois` command to get information about who is logged on to a remote system. The `whois` command is a more secure and efficient way to get information about who is logged on to a remote system. It is also supported by most Linux distributions.

The `whois` command is used to get information about a user or system on the network. It is a versatile command that can be used to get information about a variety of things, including:

* The name of the user.
* The IP address of the system.
* The time the user logged on.
* The time the user is scheduled to log off.
* The operating system of the system.

The `whois` command is used in the following syntax:

```
whois [options] [username] [hostname]
```

The `username` is the name of the user to get information about.

The `hostname` is the name of the system to get information about.

For example, to get information about the user `root` on the system `example.com`, you would use the following command:

```
whois root example.com
```

This command will return information about the user `root` on the system `example.com`, including the name of the user, the IP address of the system, the time the user logged on, and the time the user is scheduled to log off.

The `whois` command is a powerful tool that can be used to get information about a variety of things on the network. It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the benefits of using `whois`:

* It is a secure way to get information about a user or system on the network.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.
* It is a free and open-source software.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `whois`:

* It can be difficult to interpret the output of the command.
* It can be slow to get information about a user or system on a large network.

The `whois` command is a powerful tool that can be used to get information about a variety of things on the network. However, it is important to use it carefully and to understand the potential risks before you use it.

The `rusers` command is a legacy protocol that is no longer recommended for use. It is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers. Instead, you should use the `whois` command to get information about who is logged on to a remote system.
