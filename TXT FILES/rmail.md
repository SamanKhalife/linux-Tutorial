# rmail

The `rmail` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to send mail to another user on the same system. It is a simple protocol that is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers.

Instead of using the `rmail` command, you should use the `mail` command to send mail to another user on the same system. The `mail` command is a more secure and efficient way to send mail to another user on the same system. It is also supported by most Linux distributions.

The `mail` command is used to send and receive mail on a Unix-like operating system. It is a versatile command that can be used to do a variety of things, including:

* Sending mail to other users.
* Receiving mail from other users.
* Listing the mail in your mailbox.
* Deleting mail from your mailbox.
* Managing your mail filters.

The `mail` command is used in the following syntax:

```
mail [options] [recipients]
```

The `recipients` are the users to send the mail to.

For example, to send a mail to the user `root`, you would use the following command:

```
mail root
```

This command will open a mail editor where you can compose your mail. Once you have composed your mail, you can send it by pressing `Ctrl`+`D`.

The `mail` command is a powerful tool that can be used to send and receive mail on a Unix-like operating system. It is supported by most Linux distributions and is a versatile tool for managing your mail.

The `rmail` command is a legacy protocol that is no longer recommended for use. It is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers. Instead, you should use the `mail` command to send mail to another user on the same system.
