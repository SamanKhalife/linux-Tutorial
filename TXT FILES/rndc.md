# rndc
`rndc` (Remote Name Daemon Control) is a command-line tool used to manage and control the BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) DNS server. It allows administrators to communicate with and configure the named daemon dynamically. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on `rndc`, its subcommands, usage scenarios, and configuration:
`rndc` is used to send commands to the `named` daemon to perform various administrative tasks. These tasks include reloading configurations, flushing caches, viewing server status, and managing zones. 

### Key Subcommands

1. **Reload Configuration**
   - `rndc reload`: Reloads the configuration file and any new or changed zones.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc reload
     ```

2. **Flush Cache**
   - `rndc flush`: Flushes the DNS cache.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc flush
     ```

3. **Query Statistics**
   - `rndc stats`: Dumps statistics to the file specified in the BIND configuration.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc stats
     ```

4. **Stop and Restart the Server**
   - `rndc stop`: Gracefully stops the `named` daemon.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc stop
     ```
   - `rndc restart`: Restarts the `named` daemon.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc restart
     ```

5. **View Server Status**
   - `rndc status`: Displays the current status of the `named` daemon.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc status
     ```

6. **Reconfiguring Zones**
   - `rndc reconfig`: Reloads the configuration file and new or removed zones, but does not reload unchanged zones.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc reconfig
     ```

7. **Managing Zones**
   - `rndc freeze <zone>`: Freezes dynamic updates to a zone.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc freeze example.com
     ```
   - `rndc thaw <zone>`: Thaws a previously frozen zone, allowing updates.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc thaw example.com
     ```
   - `rndc sync <zone>`: Writes the current zone file to disk.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc sync example.com
     ```

8. **Trace and Debug**
   - `rndc trace`: Increases the debug level by one.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc trace
     ```
   - `rndc trace level <level>`: Sets the debug level to a specific value.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc trace level 3
     ```
   - `rndc notrace`: Sets the debug level to zero.
   - Example:
     ```
     rndc notrace
     ```

### Configuration

To use `rndc`, a key needs to be configured in both the `rndc` and `named` configuration files. The configuration typically involves creating a shared secret key that both `rndc` and `named` use to authenticate each other.

#### Configuring `rndc.conf`

Example `/etc/rndc.conf`:

```conf
options {
    default-server 127.0.0.1;
    default-key "rndc-key";
};

key "rndc-key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "randomlygeneratedbase64key==";
};
```

#### Configuring `named.conf`

Example `/etc/named.conf`:

```conf
controls {
    inet 127.0.0.1 allow { localhost; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
};

key "rndc-key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "randomlygeneratedbase64key==";
};
```

#### Generating the Key

Use the `rndc-confgen` tool to generate the key:

```bash
rndc-confgen -a -k rndc-key -b 256
```

This command generates the key and configures the default location of the `rndc` key file.

### Use Cases

1. **Dynamic DNS Management**:
   - Administrators can add, modify, or remove DNS records without restarting the DNS service, improving uptime and flexibility.

2. **Cache Management**:
   - Flushing or dumping the DNS cache helps in troubleshooting and ensuring that stale records do not cause resolution issues.

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Regularly checking the status and statistics of the DNS server helps in maintaining performance and identifying potential issues.

4. **Security and Troubleshooting**:
   - Freezing and thawing zones can be useful during maintenance or investigation of suspicious activities.

### Conclusion

`rndc` is an essential tool for managing BIND DNS servers, offering a wide range of commands for dynamic configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Proper configuration and understanding of its subcommands enable administrators to effectively control and maintain their DNS infrastructure, ensuring efficient and secure DNS operations.
