# mkraid

The `mkraid` command in Linux is used to create RAID devices. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID devices are created by combining multiple disks into a single logical disk. RAID devices can be used to improve performance, provide redundancy, or increase storage capacity.

The syntax of the `mkraid` command is as follows:

```
mkraid [options] device-name raid-level
```

The `options` argument specifies additional options for creating the RAID device. The most common options are as follows:

* `-c`: Specifies a list of disks to use for the RAID device.
* `-l`: Specifies the RAID level.
* `-n`: Specifies the name of the RAID device.

For example, the following command creates a RAID 1 device named `array1` using the disks `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, and `/dev/sdc`:

```
mkraid -c /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc -l 1 -n array1
```

The `mkraid` command uses the RAID module in the Linux kernel to create RAID devices. The RAID module is part of the Linux kernel and is typically installed when Linux is installed. If the RAID module is not installed, you must install it before running the `mkraid` command.

RAID devices are a useful tool for improving performance, providing redundancy, or increasing storage capacity. The `mkraid` command can be used to create RAID devices in Linux.
