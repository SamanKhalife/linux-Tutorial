# lpinfo

The `lpinfo` command in Linux is used to display information about printers and printer classes provided by the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS). 

The syntax for the `lpinfo` command is as follows:

```
lpinfo [options] destination
```

The `destination` argument is the printer or class that you want to get information about.

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `lpinfo` command.

Here are some of the most useful `lpinfo` options:

* `-p`: Display information about a printer.
* `-c`: Display information about a class.
* `-l`: List all printers or classes.
* `-v`: Display version information.

Here is an example of how to get information about the printer called `myprinter`:

```
lpinfo -p myprinter
```

This command will display information about the printer `myprinter`. The information will include the printer name, the printer location, and the printer status.

Here is an example of how to get information about the class called `myclass`:

```
lpinfo -c myclass
```

This command will display information about the class `myclass`. The information will include the class name, the class members, and the class default printer.

Here is an example of how to list all printers:

```
lpinfo -l
```

This command will list all printers that are configured on the system. The information will include the printer name, the printer location, and the printer status.
