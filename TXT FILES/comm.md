# comm

The `comm` command in Linux is used to compare two sorted files and display the lines that are common, different, and unique to each file. It is a powerful tool that can be used to find differences between files, or to find common lines in two files.

The `comm` command is used in the following syntax:

```
comm [options] file1 file2
```

The `file1` and `file2` are the two files that you want to compare.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-1` : Display the lines that are only in file1.
* `-2` : Display the lines that are only in file2.
* `-3` : Display the lines that are in both files.
* `-u` : Display the lines that are unique to file1 and file2.

For example, the following code will compare the files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and display the lines that are common to both files:

```
comm file1.txt file2.txt
```

This code will print the lines that are common to both files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to the standard output.
