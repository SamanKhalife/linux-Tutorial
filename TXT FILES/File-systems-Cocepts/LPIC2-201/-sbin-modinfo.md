# /sbin/modinfo
The `/sbin/modinfo` command in Linux is used to display information about kernel modules installed on the system. Hereâ€™s an in-depth explanation of what `modinfo` does and how it is used:

### Purpose of `modinfo`

1. **Module Information**:
   - `modinfo` provides detailed information about kernel modules, including their parameters, dependencies, authorship, version, license, and more.
   - This command helps administrators and users understand the capabilities and requirements of installed kernel modules.

2. **Usage Scenarios**:
   - **Module Troubleshooting**: Use `modinfo` to investigate module details when troubleshooting issues related to specific hardware or functionality.
   - **Dependency Analysis**: Check module dependencies (`depends`) to understand which other modules are required for proper operation.
   - **Configuration and Tuning**: Review module parameters (`parm`) to adjust their behavior or performance.

### How to Use `modinfo`

- **Basic Usage**: To display information about a specific kernel module, specify its name as an argument to `modinfo`.

  ```bash
  modinfo module_name
  ```

  Replace `module_name` with the name of the kernel module you want to query.

- **Example**:

  ```bash
  modinfo usb_storage
  ```

  This command would display detailed information about the `usb_storage` module, including its version, description, license, dependencies, parameters, and more.

- **Listing All Modules**: Running `modinfo` without any arguments lists information about all installed kernel modules.

  ```bash
  modinfo
  ```

- **Verbose Output**: Adding `-v` provides verbose output, showing additional details such as module aliases and the path to the module file.

  ```bash
  modinfo -v module_name
  ```

### Example Output

Here's a sample output of `modinfo usb_storage`:

```
filename:       /lib/modules/5.4.0-84-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.ko
alias:          usb:v0BC2p3001d*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*in*

### Conclusion

`modinfo` is a valuable command-line tool for querying and understanding kernel modules in Linux systems. By providing detailed insights into module characteristics and dependencies, `modinfo` helps administrators manage modules effectively, troubleshoot issues, and optimize system performance. Incorporating `modinfo` into regular system administration tasks enhances the overall reliability and functionality of Linux deployments by ensuring informed decisions regarding kernel module configuration and management.
