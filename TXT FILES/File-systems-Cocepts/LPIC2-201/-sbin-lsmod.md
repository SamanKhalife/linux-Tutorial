# /sbin/lsmod
The command `/sbin/lsmod` in Linux is used to display the currently loaded kernel modules. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what `lsmod` does and how it is used:

### Purpose of `lsmod`

1. **Module Listing**:
   - `lsmod` lists all the kernel modules that are currently loaded into the running kernel.
   - Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded into the kernel to provide additional functionality, such as device drivers or filesystem support.

2. **Dependency Checking**:
   - It displays information about each module, including its size, dependencies (other modules it depends on), and usage count.

3. **System Analysis**:
   - Administrators use `lsmod` to troubleshoot system issues related to modules, check module dependencies, and understand which modules are actively in use.

### How to Use `lsmod`

- **Basic Usage**: To display a list of loaded kernel modules, run `lsmod` without any arguments.

  ```bash
  lsmod
  ```

- **Example Output**:

  ```
  Module                  Size  Used by
  nvidia_drm             61440  1
  nvidia_modeset       1220608  2 nvidia_drm
  nvidia              21166080  65 nvidia_modeset
  drm_kms_helper        184320  1 nvidia_drm
  drm                   491520  4 drm_kms_helper,nvidia_drm
  ...
  ```

- **Detailed Information**: Use the `-v` or `--verbose` option for more detailed output, including the module parameters.

  ```bash
  lsmod -v
  ```

- **Dependency Tree**: Use the `-t` or `--tree` option to display the dependency tree of loaded modules.

  ```bash
  lsmod -t
  ```

### Usage Scenarios

- **Driver Verification**: Check if specific hardware drivers (modules) are loaded and functioning correctly.
- **Module Debugging**: Identify module dependencies or conflicts that may be causing system instability.
- **System Optimization**: Unload unnecessary modules to free up system resources or resolve conflicts.

### Conclusion

`lsmod` is a crucial command-line utility in Linux for managing and inspecting loaded kernel modules. By providing insights into module dependencies and usage, `lsmod` facilitates efficient system administration, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. Incorporating `lsmod` into regular system maintenance routines enhances the reliability and functionality of Linux-based environments by ensuring proper module management and troubleshooting capabilities.
