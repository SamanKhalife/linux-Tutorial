# /proc/mdstat

The `/proc/mdstat` file in Linux provides real-time information about the status of software RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) devices and arrays managed by the `mdadm` utility. Hereâ€™s an overview of its purpose and usage:



1. **Purpose**:
   - **Status Reporting**: `/proc/mdstat` is a pseudo-file system located at `/proc/mdstat`.
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: It provides real-time status and information about software RAID devices and arrays configured on the system.

2. **Contents**:
   - **RAID Arrays**: Displays information about each RAID array configured on the system.
   - **Device States**: Shows the state of each device within the RAID arrays (`active`, `inactive`, `degraded`, `resyncing`, `recovering`, etc.).
   - **Progress Indicators**: If a RAID array is in the process of rebuilding (`resyncing`) or recovering from a failure (`recovering`), progress indicators are shown.
   - **Errors and Warnings**: Logs errors or warnings related to RAID devices or arrays.

3. **Example Output**:
   ```
   Personalities : [raid1]
   md0 : active raid1 sda1[0] sdb1[1]
         1953517568 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
         bitmap: 0/15 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk

   md1 : active raid5 sdc1[0] sdd1[1] sde1[2]
         7814049280 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
         bitmap: 3/30 pages [12KB], 65536KB chunk

   unused devices: <none>
   ```
   - `md0` is a RAID 1 array (`raid1`) consisting of `sda1` and `sdb1`.
   - `md1` is a RAID 5 array (`raid5`) with devices `sdc1`, `sdd1`, and `sde1`.

4. **Usage**:
   - **Monitoring**: Administrators use `/proc/mdstat` to monitor the health and status of RAID arrays.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Helps diagnose issues like device failures, array degradation, or resynchronization processes (`resyncing`).
   - **Automation**: Can be parsed by monitoring tools or scripts for automated alerting or reporting on RAID status changes.

5. **Maintenance**:
   - **Resynchronization**: Monitor ongoing resynchronization (`resyncing`) processes to ensure completion.
   - **Device Replacement**: Identify failed devices (`[U_]` indicates a missing device) and replace them using `mdadm`.

6. **Access**:
   - Read access to `/proc/mdstat` is typically restricted to privileged users (root) due to its system status reporting nature.

### Conclusion

Understanding `/proc/mdstat` is crucial for administrators managing software RAID configurations in Linux. It provides vital real-time information about RAID arrays, helping maintain data redundancy and availability. Regularly monitor `/proc/mdstat` to promptly address any issues with RAID devices or arrays, ensuring optimal system performance and data integrity.
