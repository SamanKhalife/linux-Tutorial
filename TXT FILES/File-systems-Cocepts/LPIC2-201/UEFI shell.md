# UEFI shell

The **UEFI Shell** is a command-line interface provided by the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware environment. It allows users to interact directly with the systemâ€™s firmware and perform various tasks such as managing files, running scripts, and configuring the system. The UEFI Shell is particularly useful for low-level system management and troubleshooting.

### Overview

- **Purpose**: The UEFI Shell provides a command-line environment within the UEFI firmware that can be used for various tasks like executing shell commands, running scripts, and managing the UEFI environment.
- **Environment**: It operates independently of the operating system and is accessed during the system's boot process, usually through a special UEFI menu or boot option.

### Accessing the UEFI Shell

1. **Direct Boot**:
   - Some UEFI firmware implementations include the UEFI Shell as an option in the firmware settings. You can boot into it directly from the UEFI firmware setup menu.

2. **Bootable Media**:
   - You can also create a bootable USB drive with the UEFI Shell installed. This is useful for systems that do not have a built-in UEFI Shell.

   - **Creating Bootable Media**:
     - Obtain a UEFI Shell binary (e.g., `Shell.efi`).
     - Copy it to the EFI System Partition (ESP) on a USB drive.
     - Boot from the USB drive and select the UEFI Shell.

### Common Commands

Here are some common UEFI Shell commands:

1. **`help`**:
   - Displays a list of available commands and their usage.

   ```sh
   help
   ```

2. **`ls`**:
   - Lists files and directories in the current directory.

   ```sh
   ls
   ```

3. **`cd`**:
   - Changes the current directory.

   ```sh
   cd <directory>
   ```

4. **`cp`**:
   - Copies files from one location to another.

   ```sh
   cp <source> <destination>
   ```

5. **`rm`**:
   - Removes files or directories.

   ```sh
   rm <file_or_directory>
   ```

6. **`mkdir`**:
   - Creates a new directory.

   ```sh
   mkdir <directory>
   ```

7. **`echo`**:
   - Displays a message or variable value.

   ```sh
   echo "Hello, UEFI Shell!"
   ```

8. **`map`**:
   - Lists all mapped file systems, including the EFI System Partition.

   ```sh
   map
   ```

9. **`load`**:
   - Loads a UEFI application or driver.

   ```sh
   load <filename>
   ```

10. **`unload`**:
    - Unloads a UEFI application or driver.

    ```sh
    unload <filename>
    ```

11. **`bcfg`**:
    - Manages the boot configuration, including adding or removing boot entries.

    ```sh
    bcfg boot dump
    bcfg boot add 1 fs0:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI "My Boot Entry"
    ```

### Scripting in UEFI Shell

UEFI Shell supports scripting, which allows you to automate tasks using shell scripts. These scripts have a `.nsh` extension and are similar to batch files in Windows or shell scripts in Unix-like systems.

**Example `.nsh` Script**:

```sh
@echo off
echo "Starting UEFI Shell script..."
cd fs0:
mkdir MyDirectory
cp MyFile.efi MyDirectory
echo "Script completed."
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Troubleshooting**:
   - UEFI Shell can be used to diagnose and troubleshoot boot issues or firmware problems, such as testing hardware or examining system settings.

2. **Firmware Updates**:
   - Use the UEFI Shell to apply firmware updates or patches by running UEFI applications provided by the motherboard or system manufacturer.

3. **File Management**:
   - Manage files on the EFI System Partition (ESP), such as copying boot loaders or configuration files.

4. **Boot Configuration**:
   - Modify or create UEFI boot entries to change the boot order or add new boot options.

### Example Commands

1. **List File Systems**:

   ```sh
   map
   ```

2. **Change Directory and List Contents**:

   ```sh
   cd fs0:
   ls
   ```

3. **Add a New Boot Entry**:

   ```sh
   bcfg boot add 1 fs0:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI "New Boot Entry"
   ```

4. **Run a UEFI Application**:

   ```sh
   fs0:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI
   ```

### Summary

- **Purpose**: Provides a command-line environment within the UEFI firmware for system management and configuration.
- **Access**: Can be accessed via UEFI firmware setup or bootable media.
- **Commands**: Includes file management, boot configuration, and scripting.
- **Use Cases**: Troubleshooting, firmware updates, file management, and boot configuration.

The UEFI Shell is a powerful tool for advanced users and administrators who need to interact with the system at a low level, especially when dealing with firmware and boot issues.
