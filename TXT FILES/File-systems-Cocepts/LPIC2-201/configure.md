# configure

The `configure` script is a crucial component in the build process of many open-source software packages, especially those following the GNU build system (often referred to as "autotools"). It is typically used to prepare the source code for compilation on the current system by detecting the system's environment and setting up appropriate makefiles and configuration files. Here’s a detailed overview of the `configure` script and how to use it effectively:

### Purpose of `configure`

1. **System Compatibility**: Detects the system's environment, including operating system, compiler, libraries, and other dependencies, to ensure the software can be compiled and run correctly.
2. **Customizable Build**: Allows users to specify build options, such as installation directories, optional features, and optimization settings.
3. **Prepares Makefiles**: Generates `Makefile` and other configuration files required for the compilation process.

### Using `configure`

#### Basic Usage

1. **Navigate to the Source Directory**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code:

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/source-directory
   ```

2. **Run the `configure` Script**

   Execute the `configure` script:

   ```sh
   ./configure
   ```

   This will check the system environment and create appropriate `Makefile`s and configuration files.

#### Common Options

You can pass various options to the `configure` script to customize the build process. Here are some commonly used options:

1. **Specify Installation Directory**

   By default, the software is installed in `/usr/local`. To specify a different installation directory, use the `--prefix` option:

   ```sh
   ./configure --prefix=/custom/installation/directory
   ```

2. **Enable or Disable Features**

   Many packages provide options to enable or disable specific features. For example, to enable a feature:

   ```sh
   ./configure --enable-feature
   ```

   To disable a feature:

   ```sh
   ./configure --disable-feature
   ```

3. **Specify Compiler and Flags**

   You can specify a custom compiler and compilation flags using environment variables:

   ```sh
   CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -march=native" ./configure
   ```

4. **Check Configuration Options**

   To see a list of all available configuration options for a specific package, you can usually run:

   ```sh
   ./configure --help
   ```

### Advanced Usage

1. **Cross-Compilation**

   For cross-compiling (building software on one architecture to run on another), you need to specify the target system using the `--host`, `--build`, and `--target` options:

   ```sh
   ./configure --host=target-system --build=build-system --target=target-system
   ```

2. **Cache Configuration**

   You can use a cache file to speed up the configuration process in repeated builds by saving and reusing test results:

   ```sh
   ./configure --cache-file=config.cache
   ```

3. **Specify Additional Directories**

   If libraries or headers are installed in non-standard directories, you can specify their locations using `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`:

   ```sh
   CPPFLAGS="-I/custom/include" LDFLAGS="-L/custom/lib" ./configure
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: If the `configure` script reports missing dependencies, you need to install the required packages. Use your package manager to install them.
- **Configuration Logs**: If the configuration process fails, check the `config.log` file in the source directory for detailed error messages.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the `configure` script and write to the directories where the software will be installed.

### Example Workflow

Here’s an example workflow for building and installing a software package from source:

1. **Extract the Source Code**

   ```sh
   tar -xzvf software-1.0.tar.gz
   cd software-1.0
   ```

2. **Configure the Build**

   ```sh
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/software-1.0
   ```

3. **Compile the Software**

   ```sh
   make
   ```

4. **Install the Software**

   ```sh
   sudo make install
   ```

### Summary

The `configure` script is an essential tool for preparing the build environment for compiling software from source. By understanding how to use its various options and handle common issues, you can ensure a smooth and customized build process for different software packages.
