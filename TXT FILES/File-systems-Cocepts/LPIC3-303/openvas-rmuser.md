# openvas-rmuser

The `openvas-rmuser` command is used to remove user accounts from the OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) scanner. This command is essential for managing user access and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the OpenVAS system.

#### Basic Usage

To remove a user from OpenVAS, open a terminal and use the `openvas-rmuser` command followed by the username you wish to delete:

```bash
sudo openvas-rmuser <username>
```

#### Example

If the user `john` exists, you will receive a confirmation message indicating that the user has been successfully removed.

#### Security Considerations

1. **Audit User Accounts**: Regularly review and audit user accounts to ensure that only authorized users have access to OpenVAS.
2. **Remove Inactive Users**: Promptly remove accounts of users who no longer require access to the system, such as former employees or users who have changed roles.
3. **Backup Configuration**: Before making changes to user accounts, ensure that you have a backup of your OpenVAS configuration and user data.

#### Conclusion

The `openvas-rmuser` command is a straightforward tool for removing user accounts from OpenVAS. By using this command, administrators can efficiently manage user access, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the OpenVAS vulnerability scanning system.
