# radiusd.conf
`radiusd.conf` is the main configuration file for the FreeRADIUS server, which is an open-source implementation of the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol. This file contains essential settings that define how the FreeRADIUS server operates, including authentication, authorization, accounting, and other network access policies.

### Key Components in `radiusd.conf`

1. **Global Settings**: These include parameters that affect the overall behavior of the FreeRADIUS server, such as server ports, logging configuration, and paths to various directories.

2. **Module Configuration**: FreeRADIUS operates using various modules that handle different aspects of the RADIUS protocol and server functionality. Each module can be configured within `radiusd.conf` to specify its behavior and settings.

3. **Authentication Settings**: Configuration related to how users are authenticated, including supported authentication methods (e.g., PAP, CHAP, EAP), authentication realms, and authentication policies.

4. **Authorization Settings**: Defines policies and rules for authorizing access to network resources based on user credentials and other attributes.

5. **Accounting Settings**: Specifies how accounting information is logged and stored, including accounting methods (e.g., SQL, LDAP) and retention policies.

6. **Logging Configuration**: Controls the level and destination of log messages generated by the FreeRADIUS server, crucial for monitoring server activity and diagnosing issues.

7. **TLS/SSL Configuration**: If RADIUS communication is secured using TLS/SSL, configuration parameters for certificates, private keys, and cipher suites are defined here.

### Example Sections in `radiusd.conf`

#### Global Configuration

```plaintext
listen {
    type = auth
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    port = 1812
}

listen {
    type = acct
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    port = 1813
}

log {
    destination = files
    file = /var/log/radius/radius.log
    syslog_facility = daemon
    stripped_names = no
    auth_badpass = yes
    auth_goodpass = yes
}
```

#### Module Configuration

```plaintext
modules {
    ...
    ldap {
        server = "ldap.example.com"
        identity = "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
        password = "admin_password"
        base_dn = "dc=example,dc=com"
        filter = "(uid=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})"
        tls {
            start_tls = yes
            tls_cacertfile = /etc/radius/ldap-ca.pem
            tls_certfile = /etc/radius/ldap-cert.pem
            tls_keyfile = /etc/radius/ldap-key.pem
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Authentication Configuration

```plaintext
authorize {
    ...
    pap
    chap
    mschap
    ...
}

authenticate {
    ...
    Auth-Type PAP {
        pap
    }
    Auth-Type CHAP {
        chap
    }
    ...
}
```

### Location of `radiusd.conf`

The `radiusd.conf` file is typically located in the following directory:
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `/etc/freeradius/`
- **Red Hat/CentOS**: `/etc/raddb/`

### Editing `radiusd.conf`

When editing `radiusd.conf`, it's crucial to follow these best practices:
- Make backups before making changes.
- Ensure proper syntax and formatting to avoid configuration errors.
- Test changes in a controlled environment before applying them in a production environment.
- Monitor server logs (`radius.log`) for any error messages or warnings after making changes.

### Conclusion

`radiusd.conf` is the central configuration file for the FreeRADIUS server, governing its operation and behavior. Understanding and properly configuring `radiusd.conf` is essential for maintaining a secure and efficient RADIUS authentication and authorization service.
