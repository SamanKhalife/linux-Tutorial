# snort-stat

**snort-stat** is a utility designed to summarize and analyze Snort logs, providing statistical insights into the alerts generated by Snort. This tool is useful for understanding the frequency and types of alerts, which can help in fine-tuning Snort rules, identifying false positives, and getting an overview of the security posture of the monitored network.

### Key Features of snort-stat

1. **Summarization of Snort Alerts**: snort-stat reads Snort alert logs and provides a summarized view of the alerts, helping to quickly identify the most common alerts and potential issues.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: It provides statistical data on the number of alerts, types of alerts, and their distribution over time, aiding in understanding trends and patterns in network activity.

3. **Customizable Output**: The tool allows customization of the output format, enabling integration with other reporting tools or systems.

4. **Identification of False Positives**: By summarizing and analyzing alert data, snort-stat helps in identifying rules that generate false positives, allowing for rule optimization and refinement.

### Usage

#### Installation

snort-stat is not included by default in Snort installations, and it might need to be installed separately. It can usually be found in the contrib directory of the Snort source distribution or downloaded from various online repositories.

#### Basic Commands

- **Running snort-stat**: To generate a summary of Snort alerts, you need to run snort-stat and point it to your Snort alert log file.

  ```bash
  snort-stat /var/log/snort/alert
  ```

  This command processes the Snort alert log file and produces a summary report.

#### Options and Customization

snort-stat may have several options to customize the output. While these options can vary depending on the version, common customizations include:

- **Specifying the log file**: Point to a specific log file if it is not located in the default path.

  ```bash
  snort-stat -r /path/to/alert.log
  ```

- **Output format**: Customize the output format to integrate with other systems or to meet specific reporting needs.

  ```bash
  snort-stat -o html /var/log/snort/alert
  ```

  This example outputs the report in HTML format.

### Interpreting the Output

The output of snort-stat typically includes:

- **Alert Count**: The total number of alerts generated by Snort.
- **Top Alerts**: A list of the most common alerts, including the alert message and the count.
- **Alert Distribution**: The distribution of alerts over time, which can help identify periods of increased activity or potential attacks.
- **Source and Destination IPs**: Information about the IP addresses that triggered alerts, aiding in identifying potential malicious actors.

### Example Output

An example output of snort-stat might look like this:

```
Snort Alert Summary Report
==========================
Total Alerts: 1500

Top 10 Alerts:
--------------
1. [1:1000001:0] ICMP PING NMAP       - 500 occurrences
2. [1:1000002:0] SHELLCODE x86 NOOP   - 300 occurrences
3. [1:1000003:0] WEB-MISC /etc/passwd - 200 occurrences

Alert Distribution by Time:
---------------------------
Time: 00:00-01:00  - 100 alerts
Time: 01:00-02:00  - 150 alerts
...

Top Source IPs:
---------------
192.168.1.100 - 600 alerts
10.0.0.1      - 300 alerts
...

Top Destination IPs:
--------------------
192.168.1.200 - 800 alerts
10.0.0.2      - 400 alerts
...
```

### Security Considerations

- **Log Management**: Ensure that Snort logs are managed securely and that access to log files is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review and analyze Snort alert summaries to stay informed about network security events and trends.

### Conclusion

snort-stat is a valuable utility for summarizing and analyzing Snort alert logs. It provides insights into network security events, helps in identifying trends, and aids in fine-tuning Snort rules to reduce false positives. For specific deployment scenarios, advanced configuration options, and best practices, consulting the documentation that comes with snort-stat or community resources is recommended.
