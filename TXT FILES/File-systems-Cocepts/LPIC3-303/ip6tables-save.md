# ip6tables-save

The `ip6tables-save` command in Linux is used to save the current IPv6 firewall rules and settings to a file. This is analogous to `iptables-save` but specifically for IPv6 firewall configurations. Here’s how you can use `ip6tables-save` effectively:

#### Purpose

`ip6tables-save` allows you to dump the current configuration of `ip6tables` rules to stdout (standard output), which can then be redirected to a file. This is essential for saving and later restoring IPv6 firewall rules on Linux systems.

#### Basic Usage

To save the current IPv6 `ip6tables` rules to a file, follow these steps:

1. **Dump Rules to STDOUT**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip6tables-save
   ```
   This command prints out all the current IPv6 `ip6tables` rules configured on your system.

2. **Redirect Output to a File**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6
   ```
   This saves the output of `ip6tables-save` to the specified file (`rules.v6` in this example). Similar to IPv4 rules, it's common practice to save IPv6 firewall rules in `/etc/iptables/` directory or another secure location.

#### Example Output

The output of `ip6tables-save` typically includes lines formatted with rules, chains, targets, and other parameters specific to IPv6. Here’s a simplified example:

```text
# Generated by ip6tables-save v1.8.7
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j DROP
COMMIT
# Completed on Tue Jul 20 15:10:25 2024
```

#### Restoring Rules

To restore IPv6 `ip6tables` rules from a saved file (`rules.v6`), use `ip6tables-restore`:

```bash
sudo ip6tables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v6
```

This command reads the rules from `rules.v6` and applies them to the current IPv6 `ip6tables` configuration. Ensure the file (`rules.v6`) contains valid IPv6 `ip6tables` rules formatted correctly.

#### Practical Applications

- **Backup and Recovery**: Saving `ip6tables` rules allows quick restoration of configurations after system updates or in case of accidental changes.
  
- **Automation**: Automate the restoration of IPv6 firewall rules during system startup by incorporating `ip6tables-restore` in your system startup scripts (`/etc/rc.local`, systemd service, etc.).

#### Security Considerations

- **File Permissions**: Store saved IPv6 firewall rules (`rules.v6`) in a secure location (`/etc/iptables/`) with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
  
- **Review and Testing**: Before applying saved rules, review them for accuracy and test in a non-production environment to avoid disruptions in network connectivity.

#### Conclusion

`ip6tables-save` is a valuable tool for managing and backing up IPv6 `ip6tables` firewall rules in Linux. By understanding how to save and restore rules, administrators can maintain consistent firewall configurations, enhance security, and streamline system administration tasks effectively in IPv6-enabled environments.
