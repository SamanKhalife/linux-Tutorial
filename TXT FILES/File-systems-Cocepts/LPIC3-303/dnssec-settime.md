# dnssec-settime

`dnssec-settime` is a command-line utility used in the context of DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to manage the timing metadata associated with DNSSEC keys. DNSSEC ensures the integrity and authenticity of DNS data by digitally signing DNS records. Proper management of key timing parameters is crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of DNSSEC-signed zones.

### Overview of `dnssec-settime`

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of `dnssec-settime` is to adjust the timing metadata associated with DNSSEC keys. This includes setting the key activation time, key publication time, key inception time, and key expiration time. These parameters are important for the security and operation of DNSSEC-signed zones.

### Basic Usage

The usage of `dnssec-settime` typically involves specifying the key file and the desired timing parameters to be set. Hereâ€™s a general format of how it is used:

```bash
dnssec-settime [options] <keyfile> <time> [<time> ...]
```

- `<keyfile>`: Specifies the DNSSEC key file whose timing parameters need to be adjusted.
- `<time>`: Specifies the time parameter(s) to be set, such as activation time, publication time, inception time, or expiration time.

### Example

```bash
dnssec-settime Kexample.com.+008+12345.key 20230101000000 20230131120000
```

In this example:

- `Kexample.com.+008+12345.key` is the DNSSEC key file.
- `20230101000000` is the new activation time (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format).
- `20230131120000` is the new expiration time (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format).

### Key Timing Parameters

- **Activation Time**: The date and time when the key becomes active and can be used for signing DNS records.
- **Publication Time**: The date and time when the key is published in DNS zone files for distribution.
- **Inception Time**: The date and time from which the key is considered valid for use in DNSSEC operations.
- **Expiration Time**: The date and time when the key expires and should no longer be used for signing DNS records.

### Integration with DNSSEC Management

In a typical DNSSEC management workflow:

1. **Key Generation**: Use `dnssec-keygen` or `dnssec-signkey` to generate DNSSEC key pairs.
2. **Timing Adjustment**: Use `dnssec-settime` to set or adjust key timing parameters as needed.
3. **Zone Signing**: Use `dnssec-signzone` to sign DNS zone files using the DNSSEC keys.
4. **Key Rollover**: Periodically roll over DNSSEC keys to maintain security and compliance with best practices.

### Considerations

- **Security**: Properly manage and secure DNSSEC keys and associated timing metadata.
- **Automation**: Consider scripting or automating key timing adjustments for efficiency and consistency.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor key timing parameters to ensure timely rollover and compliance with DNSSEC operational requirements.

### Conclusion

`dnssec-settime` is a useful tool for DNSSEC administrators to manage and adjust key timing metadata, ensuring the security and reliability of DNSSEC-signed zones. Understanding its usage and integration with other DNSSEC tools is essential for effective DNSSEC deployment and management.
