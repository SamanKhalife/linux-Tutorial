# openvas-feed-update

The `openvas-feed-update` command is used to update the various feeds that OpenVAS relies on for vulnerability detection and network security analysis. This includes the Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs), Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) data, and the CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) data.

#### Basic Usage

To update all OpenVAS feeds, run the following command:

```bash
sudo openvas-feed-update
```

This command fetches the latest updates from the OpenVAS feed servers and applies them to your local installation.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Run the Command**:
    ```bash
    sudo openvas-feed-update
    ```

2. **Fetching Updates**:
    The command will begin downloading updates for the NVT, SCAP, and CERT feeds. You will see output indicating the progress of each feed update.

    Example output:
    ```text
    Updating NVTs...
    rsync: receiving incremental file list
    ...
    sent 324 bytes  received 2.65M bytes  176.97K bytes/sec
    total size is 104.69M  speedup is 39.37
    NVTs updated.

    Updating SCAP data...
    rsync: receiving incremental file list
    ...
    sent 324 bytes  received 4.15M bytes  250.37K bytes/sec
    total size is 204.69M  speedup is 49.37
    SCAP data updated.

    Updating CERT data...
    rsync: receiving incremental file list
    ...
    sent 324 bytes  received 1.65M bytes  130.37K bytes/sec
    total size is 104.69M  speedup is 69.37
    CERT data updated.
    ```

3. **Completion**:
    Once the updates are complete, you will see a confirmation message indicating that all feeds have been successfully updated.

#### Scheduling Regular Updates

To ensure your OpenVAS feeds are always up to date, you can schedule regular updates using a cron job. For example, to schedule the feed update to run daily at midnight, add the following line to your crontab file:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line to the crontab:

```text
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/openvas-feed-update
```

This cron job ensures that the `openvas-feed-update` command runs every day at midnight, keeping your feeds up to date.

#### Security Considerations

1. **Regular Updates**: Ensure that feed updates are performed regularly to protect against the latest vulnerabilities.
2. **Network Access**: Make sure the system running OpenVAS has network access to the OpenVAS feed servers to download updates.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly monitor the update logs to ensure that updates are being applied successfully and to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

#### Conclusion

The `openvas-feed-update` command is essential for maintaining the effectiveness of the OpenVAS vulnerability scanner. By keeping your NVT, SCAP, and CERT feeds up to date, you ensure that your vulnerability assessments are based on the latest security intelligence. Automating this process with a cron job can help maintain a secure and well-managed scanning environment.
