# /etc/openvas/
directories and files under `/etc/openvas/`. Typically, this directory contains configuration files and other settings for OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System). Hereâ€™s a overview of what you might find there:

#### 1. `openvas.conf`

- **Purpose**: This configuration file contains general settings for OpenVAS.
- **Usage**: Administrators can modify settings such as database connections, logging, and other global configurations here.

#### 2. `openvasmd.conf`

- **Purpose**: Configuration file for the OpenVAS Manager (`openvasmd`).
- **Usage**: Contains settings related to the OpenVAS Manager daemon, including database configuration, network settings, and other operational parameters.

#### 3. `openvassd.conf`

- **Purpose**: Configuration file for the OpenVAS Scanner (`openvassd`).
- **Usage**: Contains settings specific to the OpenVAS Scanner daemon, such as network listening ports, logging configuration, and scanning behavior.

#### 4. `greenbone`

- **Purpose**: Directory containing various subdirectories and configuration files related to Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) and Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM).
- **Usage**: Contains GSA configuration files (`gsad`) and other related settings.

#### 5. `cert`

- **Purpose**: Directory for SSL certificates used by OpenVAS components.
- **Usage**: Contains CA certificates, server certificates, and private keys generated by `openvas-mkcert`.

#### 6. `scapdata`

- **Purpose**: Directory containing SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) data used for compliance auditing.
- **Usage**: SCAP content files are stored here, which are used by OpenVAS for compliance checks and reporting.

#### 7. `user.conf`

- **Purpose**: Configuration file for user-specific settings in OpenVAS.
- **Usage**: Stores settings specific to individual users, such as preferred language, email notifications, etc.

#### 8. `plugins`

- **Purpose**: Directory for OpenVAS plugins, including Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs).
- **Usage**: Contains scripts and data files used by `openvassd` to perform vulnerability assessments.

#### 9. `passwd`

- **Purpose**: File containing user credentials for OpenVAS.
- **Usage**: Stores encrypted user passwords and other authentication information.

### Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Ensure that sensitive files and directories (`cert` directory, `user.conf`, `passwd`) have appropriate permissions set (`chmod` and `chown`) to restrict access.
  
- **Backups**: Regularly backup configuration files (`*.conf`) and critical data (`cert` directory) to prevent data loss in case of system failure.

- **Updates**: Keep OpenVAS and related packages (`greenbone-security-assistant`, `openvas-manager`, `openvas-scanner`) updated to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Understanding and managing these files and directories under `/etc/openvas/` is crucial for configuring and maintaining a secure and effective OpenVAS deployment.
