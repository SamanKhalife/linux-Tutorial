# sestatus


The `sestatus` command in Linux is used to display the current status of SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) on a system. This command provides essential information about whether SELinux is enabled or disabled, its current mode (enforcing, permissive, or disabled), and details about the loaded SELinux policy. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of `sestatus`, its usage, and significance:

### Purpose of `sestatus`

The main purpose of `sestatus` is to:
- Display the current operational status of SELinux.
- Provide detailed information about SELinux settings and policies.

### Key Features and Functionality

1. **Status Display**: `sestatus` shows whether SELinux is active on the system and its current mode.
2. **Policy Information**: It provides details about the loaded SELinux policy, including the policy type and version.
3. **Context Details**: Displays the current contexts for various parts of the system, such as the process context and file context.

### Usage

To use `sestatus`, open a terminal and type:

```bash
sestatus
```

### Example Output

When you run `sestatus`, you might see output similar to the following:

```bash
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Max kernel policy version:      31
```

### Explanation of Output Fields

- **SELinux status**: Indicates whether SELinux is enabled or disabled.
- **SELinuxfs mount**: Shows the mount point of the SELinux filesystem.
- **SELinux root directory**: Path to the directory containing SELinux configuration files.
- **Loaded policy name**: The name of the loaded SELinux policy (e.g., targeted, mls).
- **Current mode**: Indicates the current mode of SELinux (enforcing, permissive, or disabled).
- **Mode from config file**: The mode specified in the SELinux configuration file.
- **Policy MLS status**: Indicates whether Multi-Level Security (MLS) is enabled.
- **Policy deny_unknown status**: Shows whether unknown policy types are allowed.
- **Max kernel policy version**: The highest policy version supported by the kernel.

### Benefits

- **Quick Status Check**: Provides a quick way to check if SELinux is enabled and its current operational mode.
- **Policy Insights**: Offers insights into the loaded SELinux policy and configuration, aiding in system security audits and troubleshooting.

### Security Considerations

- **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly check the status of SELinux to ensure it is enabled and operating in the desired mode.
- **Configuration Consistency**: Ensure that the mode and policies reported by `sestatus` align with organizational security requirements and configurations.

### Conclusion

The `sestatus` command is a valuable tool for system administrators to quickly and easily verify the status and configuration of SELinux on a system. By using `sestatus`, administrators can ensure that SELinux is properly configured and operating as expected, thereby maintaining the security posture of the system.
