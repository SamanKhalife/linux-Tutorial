# pam_limits.so

The `pam_limits.so` module is part of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) framework on Unix-like systems. It allows administrators to set and enforce resource limits (such as maximum number of processes, maximum CPU time, and maximum file size) for user sessions. Hereâ€™s an overview of `pam_limits.so`, its purpose, configuration, and significance:

### Purpose of `pam_limits.so`

The main purpose of `pam_limits.so` is to:
- Enforce system-wide resource limits on a per-user or per-group basis.
- Enhance security and stability by preventing users or processes from consuming excessive resources.
- Customize resource limits for specific user sessions without modifying global system settings.

### Key Features and Functionality

1. **Resource Limitation**: `pam_limits.so` enables administrators to specify limits for various system resources, including:
   - Maximum CPU time (`maxcpu`)
   - Maximum number of simultaneous processes (`maxproc`)
   - Maximum size of core files (`core`)
   - Maximum size of data segments (`data`)
   - Maximum size of file locks (`fsize`)
   - Maximum number of open files (`nofile`)
   - Maximum number of locked memory pages (`memlock`)
   - Maximum number of pending signals (`sigpending`)
   - Maximum number of queued signals (`msgqueue`)

2. **Configuration Options**: The configuration of `pam_limits.so` is typically managed through the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file, where administrators can define limits for specific users or groups. However, `pam_limits.so` itself is enabled through PAM configuration files (`/etc/pam.d/` directory).

3. **Soft and Hard Limits**: Similar to `/etc/security/limits.conf`, `pam_limits.so` supports soft and hard limits:
   - **Soft Limits**: Advisory limits that can be exceeded temporarily.
   - **Hard Limits**: Absolute limits that cannot be exceeded.

4. **Integration with PAM**: `pam_limits.so` integrates with the PAM framework, allowing administrators to enforce resource limits during the authentication and session setup phases of user login.

### Configuration Example

To enable `pam_limits.so` for setting resource limits, you would typically configure the appropriate PAM file (`/etc/pam.d/common-session` or similar) to include the following line:

```plaintext
session required pam_limits.so
```

Then, configure resource limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf`. For example:

```plaintext
# Allow core dumps, but set the limit for all users
* soft core 0
* hard core unlimited

# Limit maximum number of processes for all users
* soft nproc 100
* hard nproc 200

# Limit maximum number of open files for all users
* soft nofile 1024
* hard nofile 4096
```

### Security Considerations

- **Impact Assessment**: Understand the impact of setting limits on users and processes before applying them.
  
- **Testing**: Test limits in a controlled environment to ensure they do not adversely affect system functionality or user workflows.

- **Monitoring**: Monitor system logs and performance after applying limits to detect any unexpected behavior or resource contention.

### Conclusion

`pam_limits.so` is a valuable component of the PAM framework, allowing administrators to enforce resource limits for user sessions on Unix-like systems. By configuring `pam_limits.so` appropriately, administrators can enhance system security and stability by preventing resource abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation.
