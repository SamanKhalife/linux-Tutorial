# getcap

The `getcap` command in Linux is used to display the capabilities of files. Capabilities are a finer-grained way to grant specific privileges to executables, rather than giving them full root privileges through setuid. This allows for better security practices by reducing the potential impact of vulnerabilities in privileged executables.

### Overview of `getcap`

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of `getcap` is to list the capabilities of a specified file. This helps administrators understand what specific privileges a file has been granted.

### Basic Usage

The general syntax for `getcap` is:

```bash
getcap [options] <file> [file...]
```

- `<file>`: The path to the file whose capabilities you want to display.

### Example Usages

1. **Displaying Capabilities of a Single File**

   To display the capabilities of a single file, simply provide the path to the file:

   ```bash
   getcap /path/to/file
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   getcap /usr/bin/ping
   ```

   Output:
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
   ```

   This output indicates that the `ping` command has the `cap_net_raw` capability with `ep` (effective and permitted) flags.

2. **Displaying Capabilities of Multiple Files**

   You can list capabilities for multiple files by specifying their paths:

   ```bash
   getcap /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   getcap /usr/bin/ping /usr/sbin/tcpdump
   ```

3. **Displaying Capabilities Recursively**

   To display capabilities of all files in a directory recursively, use the `-r` option:

   ```bash
   getcap -r /path/to/directory
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   getcap -r /usr/bin
   ```

### Capabilities Overview

Capabilities are divided into different categories and can be set with specific flags. Here are some common capabilities:

- `cap_net_raw`: Allow raw socket operations.
- `cap_net_admin`: Perform various network-related operations.
- `cap_sys_admin`: Perform various system administration tasks.
- `cap_sys_ptrace`: Trace arbitrary processes using `ptrace`.

### Example Capabilities and Their Meanings

- `cap_net_raw+ep`: Grants the file the ability to perform raw network operations (`cap_net_raw`) with effective (`e`) and permitted (`p`) flags.
- `cap_net_admin+eip`: Grants the file network administration capabilities with effective (`e`), inheritable (`i`), and permitted (`p`) flags.

### Conclusion

`getcap` is a useful command for displaying the capabilities of files in a Linux system. By granting specific capabilities to executables, administrators can improve security by limiting the privileges of these executables to only those necessary for their operation.
