# robocopy
Robocopy (Robust File Copy) is a powerful command-line directory replication tool included with Microsoft Windows (starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008). It’s designed to copy files and directories efficiently—even over unreliable networks—and offers a rich set of options that make it a favorite among system administrators and power users.

### Key Features

- **Resilience & Robustness**:  
  Robocopy automatically retries failed copies, can resume interrupted transfers, and is designed to cope with transient network issues. It provides options for retry count and wait time between retries.

- **Multithreaded Copying**:  
  With the `/MT` option, Robocopy can perform multi-threaded copies, dramatically increasing throughput when copying large numbers of files or large files across fast networks.

- **Selective Copying**:  
  You can filter files based on attributes, size, timestamps, and even file names (using wildcards), allowing for granular control over what gets copied.

- **Preserving Metadata**:  
  It can preserve NTFS file attributes, timestamps, NTFS ACLs (permissions), and even owner information, ensuring that the destination is an exact mirror of the source.

- **Mirror & Differential Copy**:  
  Robocopy supports mirroring directories (making the destination an exact copy of the source) and can be used to perform incremental or differential backups, copying only the files that have changed.

- **Logging and Reporting**:  
  Detailed logging options let administrators capture and analyze the copy process. Logs can include information about skipped files, retry attempts, and errors.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
robocopy <Source> <Destination> [<File>[ ...]] [<Options>]
```

**Example:**  
To copy all files from `C:\SourceFolder` to `D:\BackupFolder` while retrying failed copies 5 times with a 30-second delay between retries:
```bash
robocopy C:\SourceFolder D:\BackupFolder /E /R:5 /W:30
```
- `/E`: Copies all subdirectories, including empty ones.
- `/R:5`: Retries 5 times on failed copies.
- `/W:30`: Waits 30 seconds between retries.

For multithreaded copying (8 threads):
```bash
robocopy C:\SourceFolder D:\BackupFolder /E /MT:8
```

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Backup and Synchronization**:  
   Robocopy is widely used for creating backups and keeping directories synchronized. Its ability to perform incremental copies means only new or changed files are copied, saving time and bandwidth.

2. **Deployment and Migration**:  
   When migrating data between servers or deploying applications across multiple machines, Robocopy ensures that files, permissions, and directory structures are faithfully reproduced on the target system.

3. **Disaster Recovery**:  
   As part of a disaster recovery plan, Robocopy can be used to maintain up-to-date copies of critical directories, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss in the event of a failure.

4. **Large-Scale File Transfers**:  
   In enterprise environments, Robocopy is frequently used to move large volumes of data with high reliability, leveraging its multithreaded capabilities for speed.

### Quantitative Analysis & Community Feedback

- **StackOverflow Activity**:  
  Robocopy is a frequent topic on StackOverflow, with numerous questions addressing its syntax, options, and troubleshooting scenarios. It is a well-established tool with a mature knowledge base.

- **Hacker News & Technical Blogs**:  
  Discussions on Hacker News and various technical blogs often highlight Robocopy’s reliability and performance, especially when compared with older Windows copy utilities or in discussions about automating backup tasks on Windows.

- **GitHub & Open Source Projects**:  
  While Robocopy itself is a Microsoft tool (and therefore not hosted on GitHub), there are many open source projects and scripts on GitHub that wrap Robocopy functionality for deployment and automation tasks. These projects often boast hundreds to thousands of stars, reflecting widespread adoption in the Windows sysadmin community.

### Conclusion

Robocopy is a versatile, robust, and efficient file replication tool for Windows environments. Its extensive feature set—from multithreaded copying to preserving detailed NTFS metadata—makes it an indispensable utility for backup, synchronization, and migration tasks. Widely discussed in communities like StackOverflow and backed by numerous real-world usage examples in enterprise environments, Robocopy stands out as the Windows counterpart to Linux’s rsync, with strong integration into Windows file system features and excellent reliability for large-scale file transfers.

If you’re looking to automate backup tasks or perform reliable file replication on Windows, Robocopy’s rich set of options and proven performance make it an excellent choice.
