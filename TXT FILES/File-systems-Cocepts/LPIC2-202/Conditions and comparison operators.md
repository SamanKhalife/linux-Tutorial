# Conditions and comparison operators

In many programming and scripting languages, conditions and comparison operators are fundamental concepts used to make decisions and control the flow of execution. Hereâ€™s an overview of common conditions and comparison operators found in various languages, including Bash, Python, and SQL.

### 1. **Bash (Shell Scripting)**

**Conditions:**
- Conditions in Bash are typically used with `if`, `while`, and `until` statements.
- The `test` command or `[` and `]` are used to evaluate conditions.

**Comparison Operators:**
- **String Comparison:**
  - `=`: Check if two strings are equal.
  - `!=`: Check if two strings are not equal.
  - `<`: Check if one string is less than another (in alphabetical order).
  - `>`: Check if one string is greater than another (in alphabetical order).
- **Numeric Comparison:**
  - `-eq`: Equal to.
  - `-ne`: Not equal to.
  - `-lt`: Less than.
  - `-le`: Less than or equal to.
  - `-gt`: Greater than.
  - `-ge`: Greater than or equal to.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

num1=10
num2=20
if [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]; then
    echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
fi

str1="hello"
str2="world"
if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]; then
    echo "Strings are equal"
else
    echo "Strings are not equal"
fi
```

### 2. **Python**

**Conditions:**
- Conditions in Python are used with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Python uses boolean expressions and relies on indentation for blocks of code.

**Comparison Operators:**
- `==`: Equal to.
- `!=`: Not equal to.
- `<`: Less than.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to.
- `>`: Greater than.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to.

**Example:**
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
if num1 < num2:
    print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}")

str1 = "hello"
str2 = "world"
if str1 == str2:
    print("Strings are equal")
else:
    print("Strings are not equal")
```

### 3. **SQL**

**Conditions:**
- SQL uses conditions in `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `CASE` statements to filter records and perform conditional logic.

**Comparison Operators:**
- `=`: Equal to.
- `<>` or `!=`: Not equal to.
- `<`: Less than.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to.
- `>`: Greater than.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to.
- `BETWEEN`: Range check.
- `LIKE`: Pattern matching.
- `IN`: Check if a value is in a list of values.
- `IS NULL`: Check for NULL values.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT');

SELECT name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary >= 60000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary >= 40000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_range
FROM employees;
```

### Summary

- **Bash**: Uses `test` command or `[ ]` with `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, `-ge` for numeric comparisons and `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>` for string comparisons.
- **Python**: Uses `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for both numeric and string comparisons.
- **SQL**: Uses `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and `IS NULL` for comparisons and conditions.

Understanding these operators and how to use them in different contexts is crucial for writing effective conditional statements and performing comparisons in your scripts and queries.
