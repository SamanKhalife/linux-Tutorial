# SMB Daemons: smbd, nmbd, winbindd

The SMB protocol daemons, smbd, nmbd, and winbindd, are core components of the Samba suite, which provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients. Hereâ€™s an overview of each daemon, their purposes, and configuration options:

#### smbd

`smbd` is the server daemon that provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. It handles the file-sharing and printing capabilities of Samba.

- **Purpose**: 
  - Provides file sharing.
  - Provides print services.
  - Manages authentication and authorization.

- **Configuration**:
  - Configured in the `smb.conf` file, typically located in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`.

- **Key Options**:
  - **[global]** section: Configures global settings.
  - **[share]** sections: Configures individual shares.

- **Common Usage**:
  - Start: `sudo systemctl start smbd`
  - Stop: `sudo systemctl stop smbd`
  - Restart: `sudo systemctl restart smbd`

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```conf
  [global]
      workgroup = WORKGROUP
      server string = Samba Server
      security = user

  [share]
      path = /srv/samba/share
      writable = yes
      guest ok = no
  ```

#### nmbd

`nmbd` is the server daemon that provides NetBIOS name service to SMB/CIFS clients. It handles the network browsing and name resolution.

- **Purpose**:
  - Provides NetBIOS name service.
  - Facilitates network browsing.
  - Supports WINS (Windows Internet Name Service).

- **Configuration**:
  - Configured in the `smb.conf` file, often in conjunction with `smbd`.

- **Key Options**:
  - **[global]** section: Configures global settings related to network browsing and name resolution.

- **Common Usage**:
  - Start: `sudo systemctl start nmbd`
  - Stop: `sudo systemctl stop nmbd`
  - Restart: `sudo systemctl restart nmbd`

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```conf
  [global]
      workgroup = WORKGROUP
      server string = Samba Server
      security = user
      wins support = yes
  ```

#### winbindd

`winbindd` is the server daemon that provides a unified login for Windows and Unix accounts. It allows Unix systems to use Windows domain accounts for authentication.

- **Purpose**:
  - Integrates Unix systems with Windows NT-based systems.
  - Provides access to Windows domain users and groups.
  - Facilitates single sign-on (SSO) in mixed environments.

- **Configuration**:
  - Configured in the `smb.conf` file, especially in environments where Samba integrates with Windows domains.

- **Key Options**:
  - **[global]** section: Configures settings for domain membership and winbind integration.

- **Common Usage**:
  - Start: `sudo systemctl start winbind`
  - Stop: `sudo systemctl stop winbind`
  - Restart: `sudo systemctl restart winbind`

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```conf
  [global]
      workgroup = WORKGROUP
      security = ads
      realm = EXAMPLE.COM
      password server = adserver.example.com
      idmap config * : backend = tdb
      idmap config * : range = 1000-2000
      idmap config EXAMPLE : backend = rid
      idmap config EXAMPLE : range = 2001-100000
  ```

### Installation and Management

#### Installation

To install Samba, which includes `smbd`, `nmbd`, and `winbindd`, use your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba winbind
```

#### Management

Start, stop, and enable the services using `systemctl`:

```bash
# Start services
sudo systemctl start smbd
sudo systemctl start nmbd
sudo systemctl start winbind

# Stop services
sudo systemctl stop smbd
sudo systemctl stop nmbd
sudo systemctl stop winbind

# Enable services to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable smbd
sudo systemctl enable nmbd
sudo systemctl enable winbind

# Check status
sudo systemctl status smbd
sudo systemctl status nmbd
sudo systemctl status winbind
```

### Use Cases

- **File and Print Sharing**: `smbd` is essential for sharing files and printers with Windows clients.
- **Network Browsing and Name Resolution**: `nmbd` allows Windows clients to see the Samba server in their network neighborhood.
- **Domain Integration**: `winbindd` enables Unix systems to authenticate users against a Windows domain, facilitating SSO.

### Conclusion

Understanding and configuring `smbd`, `nmbd`, and `winbindd` is crucial for administrators managing a mixed network environment. Proper configuration in the `smb.conf` file ensures seamless integration and reliable service for both Unix and Windows clients.
