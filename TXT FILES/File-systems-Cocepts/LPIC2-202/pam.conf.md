# pam.conf
The `pam.conf` file is part of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system, which provides a way to configure authentication methods for various services on a Linux system. PAM allows administrators to choose how users authenticate, set rules for password policies, manage access control, and more.

### Structure of pam.conf

#### Location
- **Location**: The `pam.conf` file is typically located in `/etc/pam.conf`. However, many Linux distributions use individual configuration files for each service in `/etc/pam.d/` instead.

#### Basic Structure

The structure of the `pam.conf` file consists of lines with four fields:

1. **Service**: The name of the service (e.g., `login`, `sshd`, `passwd`).
2. **Type**: The management group to which the rule applies (e.g., `auth`, `account`, `password`, `session`).
3. **Control-Flag**: Specifies the behavior of PAM if the module fails (e.g., `required`, `requisite`, `sufficient`, `optional`).
4. **Module**: The PAM module to be invoked (e.g., `pam_unix.so`, `pam_securetty.so`).

#### Example Configuration

Here is an example of a `pam.conf` file:

```plaintext
# /etc/pam.conf

# Authentication management for login service
login   auth       required     pam_securetty.so
login   auth       requisite    pam_nologin.so
login   auth       required     pam_env.so
login   auth       sufficient   pam_unix.so try_first_pass
login   auth       required     pam_deny.so

# Account management for login service
login   account    required     pam_unix.so

# Password management for login service
login   password   required     pam_unix.so

# Session management for login service
login   session    required     pam_limits.so
login   session    required     pam_unix.so
login   session    optional     pam_lastlog.so

# Authentication management for sshd service
sshd    auth       required     pam_env.so
sshd    auth       sufficient   pam_unix.so
sshd    auth       required     pam_deny.so

# Account management for sshd service
sshd    account    required     pam_unix.so

# Password management for sshd service
sshd    password   required     pam_unix.so

# Session management for sshd service
sshd    session    required     pam_limits.so
sshd    session    optional     pam_lastlog.so
```

### Explanation of Fields

- **Service**: Indicates the service (e.g., `login`, `sshd`) to which the PAM rule applies.
- **Type**: Specifies the management group:
  - `auth`: Authentication and authorization.
  - `account`: Account management.
  - `password`: Password management.
  - `session`: Session setup and teardown.
- **Control-Flag**:
  - `required`: The module must succeed for the overall result to be successful. Failure will be reported only after all modules are processed.
  - `requisite`: Similar to `required`, but failure causes an immediate abort.
  - `sufficient`: Success means no further modules are processed. Failure is ignored if a previous `required` module has succeeded.
  - `optional`: Success or failure is ignored unless no other modules of the given type succeed.
- **Module**: The actual PAM module to use, with optional arguments.

### Common PAM Modules

- `pam_unix.so`: Provides standard UNIX authentication.
- `pam_securetty.so`: Ensures that root can only log in on secure TTYs.
- `pam_env.so`: Sets environment variables.
- `pam_nologin.so`: Prevents non-root users from logging in when `/etc/nologin` exists.
- `pam_limits.so`: Sets resource limits.
- `pam_lastlog.so`: Logs and displays the last login time.
- `pam_deny.so`: Denies access.

### Managing PAM Configuration

1. **Editing `/etc/pam.conf`**: Directly edit this file for system-wide settings. Make sure to understand the implications of each change, as incorrect configurations can lock users out of the system.
2. **Using `/etc/pam.d/` Directory**: Most modern distributions use this directory to split configurations by service. Each file in this directory corresponds to a service and contains PAM rules specific to that service.

### Best Practices

- **Backup Configuration**: Always back up `pam.conf` or the contents of `/etc/pam.d/` before making changes.
- **Test Changes**: If possible, test changes on a non-production system or during a maintenance window.
- **Read Documentation**: Refer to `man pam.conf`, `man pam`, and the documentation for individual PAM modules.

### Example of a Specific Service Configuration

For example, the SSH service typically uses a file in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` instead of entries in `/etc/pam.conf`:

```plaintext
# /etc/pam.d/sshd

# PAM configuration for the Secure Shell daemon

# Authentication management
auth       required     pam_env.so
auth       sufficient   pam_unix.so
auth       required     pam_deny.so

# Account management
account    required     pam_unix.so

# Password management
password   required     pam_unix.so

# Session management
session    required     pam_limits.so
session    optional     pam_lastlog.so
```

### Conclusion

Understanding and configuring PAM is crucial for managing authentication and access on Linux systems. Always proceed with caution, as changes can significantly impact system security and user access.
