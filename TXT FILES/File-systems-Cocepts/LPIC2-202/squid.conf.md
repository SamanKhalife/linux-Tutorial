# squid.conf
The `squid.conf` file is the main configuration file for Squid, a popular open-source proxy server and web cache daemon. It controls various aspects of Squid's behavior, caching policies, access controls, and more. Here are some key sections and directives you'll typically find in `squid.conf`:

### 1. Access Controls

#### acl
Defines Access Control Lists (ACLs) to specify which clients or requests are allowed or denied access.

**Example:**
```squid
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24
acl SSL_ports port 443
```

#### http_access
Specifies the access rules based on ACLs for allowing or denying HTTP requests.

**Example:**
```squid
http_access allow localnet
http_access deny all
```

### 2. Cache Settings

#### cache_dir
Specifies the directory and size of the disk cache used by Squid.

**Example:**
```squid
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
```

#### refresh_pattern
Defines how Squid handles caching based on URL patterns and refresh patterns.

**Example:**
```squid
refresh_pattern ^ftp:           1440    20%     10080
```

### 3. Authentication

#### auth_param
Configures authentication parameters, such as authentication schemes and realms.

**Example:**
```squid
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
auth_param basic children 5
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
```

#### acl
Defines ACLs for authentication purposes.

**Example:**
```squid
acl auth_users proxy_auth REQUIRED
```

#### http_access
Specifies access rules based on authentication ACLs.

**Example:**
```squid
http_access allow auth_users
http_access deny all
```

### 4. Network Configuration

#### http_port
Specifies the port on which Squid listens for incoming HTTP requests.

**Example:**
```squid
http_port 3128
```

#### cache_peer
Configures upstream proxy servers for hierarchical caching.

**Example:**
```squid
cache_peer parent-proxy.example.com parent 8080 0 no-query default
```

### 5. Logging

#### access_log
Specifies the location and format of the access log file.

**Example:**
```squid
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid
```

#### cache_log
Specifies the location and format of the cache log file.

**Example:**
```squid
cache_log /var/log/squid/cache.log
```

### 6. SSL/TLS

#### https_port
Specifies the port on which Squid listens for incoming HTTPS requests.

**Example:**
```squid
https_port 443 cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert.pem key=/etc/squid/ssl_key.pem
```

### 7. Miscellaneous

#### forwarded_for
Controls how Squid handles the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Example:**
```squid
forwarded_for on
```

#### visible_hostname
Sets the visible hostname for error messages and HTTP headers.

**Example:**
```squid
visible_hostname proxy.example.com
```

### Notes

- **Configuration Syntax**: `squid.conf` uses a hierarchical, block-structured syntax similar to many other configuration files.
  
- **Security**: Ensure that ACLs and access rules (`http_access`) are carefully configured to prevent unauthorized access.
  
- **Performance**: Adjust cache settings (`cache_dir`, `refresh_pattern`) based on expected usage patterns and available disk space.
  
- **Logging**: Configure logging (`access_log`, `cache_log`) to monitor Squid's activity and troubleshoot issues.

This overview covers essential directives commonly found in `squid.conf`. Squid's flexibility allows for extensive customization to meet specific caching, security, and performance requirements in various network environments. Adjust these configurations according to your specific needs and security policies.
