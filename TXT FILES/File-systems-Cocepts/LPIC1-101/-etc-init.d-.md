# /etc/init.d/

The `/etc/init.d/` directory is a key component of the traditional SysVinit system, housing the initialization scripts for managing services on a Linux system. These scripts control the starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of services. Each script typically corresponds to a specific service, such as `apache2`, `mysql`, or `ssh`.

### Understanding `/etc/init.d/`

#### Directory Structure

The `/etc/init.d/` directory contains a collection of scripts that are used to control services. These scripts are invoked by the `init` system at boot, shutdown, and when changing runlevels.

#### Example Scripts

Here’s a partial listing of what the `/etc/init.d/` directory might contain:

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/
├── apache2
├── cron
├── networking
├── ssh
└── mysql
```

### Common Operations with Init Scripts

#### Starting a Service

To start a service, use the `start` command:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
```

#### Stopping a Service

To stop a service, use the `stop` command:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
```

#### Restarting a Service

To restart a service, use the `restart` command:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

#### Checking the Status of a Service

To check the status of a service, use the `status` command:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 status
```

### Anatomy of an Init Script

Init scripts are typically written in shell script and follow a standard structure. Here’s a simplified example of an init script for a hypothetical service:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          example-service
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $remote_fs
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Example service
# Description:       This is a simple example of an init script
### END INIT INFO

# Source function library.
. /lib/lsb/init-functions

case "$1" in
  start)
    log_daemon_msg "Starting example service" "example-service"
    # Commands to start service
    log_end_msg $?
    ;;
  stop)
    log_daemon_msg "Stopping example service" "example-service"
    # Commands to stop service
    log_end_msg $?
    ;;
  restart)
    log_daemon_msg "Restarting example service" "example-service"
    $0 stop
    $0 start
    ;;
  status)
    # Commands to check status of service
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

exit 0
```

### Explanation of Key Sections

- **Shebang (`#!/bin/sh`)**: Indicates that the script should be run using the `/bin/sh` shell.
- **INIT INFO Block**: Metadata for the init system, providing information about the script's dependencies, start and stop priorities, and descriptions.
- **Function Library**: Sourcing the `/lib/lsb/init-functions` library provides functions like `log_daemon_msg` and `log_end_msg` for logging service actions.
- **Case Statement**: Handles different actions (start, stop, restart, status) based on the argument passed to the script.

### Enabling and Disabling Services

To enable a service to start automatically at boot, create symbolic links in the appropriate runlevel directories (`/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/`).

#### Enable a Service

Using the `update-rc.d` command:

```sh
sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults
```

This creates the necessary symlinks for the `apache2` service to start at the default runlevels.

#### Disable a Service

To disable a service:

```sh
sudo update-rc.d apache2 remove
```

This removes the symlinks, preventing the service from starting at boot.

### Migrating to `systemd`

With many modern Linux distributions now using `systemd`, services are often managed through systemd unit files rather than init scripts. However, backward compatibility allows many init scripts to be invoked by `systemd`.

To convert an init script to a `systemd` service unit, you typically create a unit file in `/etc/systemd/system/`. Here’s an example conversion for `apache2`:

#### Example Systemd Unit File for Apache2

```ini
[Unit]
Description=The Apache HTTP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/apachectl start
ExecStop=/usr/sbin/apachectl stop
ExecReload=/usr/sbin/apachectl graceful
Type=forking

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- **[Unit]**: Describes the service and its dependencies.
- **[Service]**: Defines how the service should be started, stopped, and reloaded.
- **[Install]**: Specifies how the service should be enabled or linked to targets.

### Conclusion

The `/etc/init.d/` directory and its scripts are fundamental to the SysVinit system, providing control over system services. Understanding how to use and write these scripts is essential for managing services on systems that still use SysVinit or for understanding legacy systems. Transitioning to `systemd` simplifies and unifies service management with more advanced features and capabilities.
