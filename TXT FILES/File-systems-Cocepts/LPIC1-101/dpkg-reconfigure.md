# dpkg-reconfigure

The `dpkg-reconfigure` command is a powerful tool in Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, that allows you to reconfigure an already installed package. This command re-runs the configuration process for a package, allowing you to change settings and options that were selected during the initial installation.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for `dpkg-reconfigure` is:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure [options] package_name
```

- **package_name**: The name of the package you want to reconfigure.

### Example Usage

#### Reconfiguring a Package

For example, to reconfigure the `tzdata` package (which sets the system timezone), you would use:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

This command will bring up the configuration dialog for `tzdata`, allowing you to select a new timezone.

### Options

`dpkg-reconfigure` supports several options to control its behavior:

- **`-a`**: Reconfigure all installed packages.
- **`-f`**: Specify the frontend to use (e.g., `dialog`, `readline`, `noninteractive`).
- **`-p`**: Set the priority of questions to be asked (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`).
- **`-u`**: Use debconf database values without prompting.
- **`--default-priority`**: Use the default priority for questions.

### Frontends

You can specify the frontend that `dpkg-reconfigure` should use to interact with you during the reconfiguration process. The most common frontends are:

- **dialog**: Provides a text-based user interface.
- **readline**: Provides a command-line interface.
- **noninteractive**: Runs without user interaction, using default values or pre-configured settings.

To specify a frontend, use the `-f` option:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -f readline package_name
```

### Priorities

You can control which questions are asked during reconfiguration by setting the priority level with the `-p` option. The priority levels are:

- **low**: Ask all questions.
- **medium**: Ask only medium and higher priority questions.
- **high**: Ask only high and critical priority questions.
- **critical**: Ask only critical questions.

To set the priority level, use the `-p` option:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high package_name
```

### Common Use Cases

#### Changing Keyboard Layout

To reconfigure the keyboard layout, you can reconfigure the `keyboard-configuration` package:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

#### Reconfiguring Display Manager

If you have multiple display managers installed (e.g., `gdm3`, `lightdm`, `sddm`), you can reconfigure the display manager selection:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
```

#### Updating Postfix Configuration

To update the configuration of the Postfix mail server:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
```

### Conclusion

The `dpkg-reconfigure` command is an essential tool for managing the configuration of installed packages on Debian-based systems. It provides a way to revisit and modify package settings without reinstalling the package. By understanding how to use `dpkg-reconfigure`, you can efficiently manage your system's configuration and adapt it to your needs.
