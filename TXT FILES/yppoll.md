The `yppoll` command is a command-line utility that can be used to poll a NIS (Network Information Service) server for changes to a map. NIS is a service that provides a central repository for user and group information.

The `yppoll` command is used as follows:

```
yppoll [options] [map name] [server]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `yppoll` command.
* `map name`: This is the name of the NIS map.
* `server`: This is the name of the NIS server.

The `yppoll` command has a number of options that can be used to control the polling process. Some of the most commonly used `yppoll` options are:

* `-h`: This option specifies the hostname of the NIS server.
* `-p`: This option specifies the port number of the NIS server.
* `-t`: This option specifies the timeout for the poll in seconds. The default timeout is 30 seconds.
* `-v`: This option prints verbose output to the console.

For example, the following command will poll the NIS server `server1` for changes to the map `passwd`:

```
yppoll -h server1 passwd
```

The output of the `yppoll` command will be a list of the changes that have been made to the map since the last time it was polled. If there have been no changes to the map, the output of the command will be `no changes`.

The `yppoll` command is a valuable tool for system administrators who need to keep NIS maps up-to-date. It can also be used by users to check for changes to their user or group information.

Here are some of the benefits of using `yppoll`:

* It is a simple and easy-to-use command.
* It can be used to poll NIS maps of different platforms.
* It is reliable and efficient.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `yppoll`:

* It can be slow for large NIS maps.
* It can be difficult to troubleshoot if there are problems with the poll.
* It is not as secure as some other methods of polling NIS maps.
