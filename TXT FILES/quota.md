# quota

A quota is a limit on the amount of something that someone is allowed to have or is expected to do. Quotas can be used in a variety of contexts, including:

* **Import quotas:** Governments can use import quotas to limit the amount of goods that can be imported into a country. This can be done to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.
* **Export quotas:** Governments can use export quotas to limit the amount of goods that can be exported from a country. This can be done to conserve resources or to protect foreign markets from being flooded with cheap goods.
* **Fishing quotas:** Governments can use fishing quotas to limit the amount of fish that can be caught in a particular area. This can be done to protect fish stocks from depletion.
* **Quotas in employment:** Companies can use quotas to set a target number of employees from a particular group, such as women or minorities. This can be done to promote diversity in the workplace.
* **Quotas in education:** Schools can use quotas to set a target number of students from a particular group, such as low-income families or students with disabilities. This can be done to ensure that all students have equal access to education.

Quotas can be controversial, as they can be seen as a form of discrimination. However, they can also be seen as a necessary tool for managing resources and ensuring fairness.

Here are some examples of quotas in use today:

* The United States government has import quotas on sugar, dairy products, and textiles.
* The European Union has import quotas on bananas and rice.
* The Chinese government has export quotas on soybeans and wheat.
* The United Nations has fishing quotas in place for many different species of fish.
* Many companies have quotas for hiring and promoting women and minorities.
* Some schools have quotas for admitting students from low-income families or students with disabilities.
