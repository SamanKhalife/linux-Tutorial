# autoscan 

The `autoscan` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to generate a preliminary `configure.in` file for a software package. It is no longer necessary to use this command, as `configure.in` files can now be generated automatically by the `autoconf` command.

The `autoscan` command was used in the following syntax:

```
autoscan
```

This command would generate a preliminary `configure.in` file in the current directory.

The `autoscan` command is no longer necessary, as `configure.in` files can now be generated automatically by the `autoconf` command. The `autoconf` command is a more powerful and flexible tool than `autoscan`.

Here are some additional things to note about the `autoscan` command:

* The `autoscan` command is no longer necessary.
* The `autoscan` command is deprecated.
* The `autoconf` command is a more powerful and flexible tool than `autoscan`.
* The `autoconf` command can be used to generate `configure.in` files for a variety of software packages.
* The `autoconf` command is a standard tool that is included in most Linux distributions.
