There is no command called `esdrec` in Linux. Are you referring to `edquota`?

The `edquota` command in Linux is used to edit disk quotas for users and groups. It is a powerful tool that can be used to control the amount of disk space that users and groups can use.

The `edquota` command is used in the following syntax:

```
edquota [options] user_name|group_name
```

The `user_name` or `group_name` is the name of the user or group that you want to edit the quotas for.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-u` : Edit the quotas for a user.
* `-g` : Edit the quotas for a group.
* `-p` : Copy the quotas from one user or group to another.
* `-f` : Force the quota update.

For example, the following code will edit the quotas for the user `johndoe`:

```
edquota -u johndoe
```

This code will open an editor, such as vi or vim, where you can edit the quotas for the user `johndoe`.

The `edquota` command is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to manage disk quotas for users and groups. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used by system administrators to manage disk quotas on a Linux system.
