The `pwd` command stands for "print working directory". It prints the absolute path of the current working directory. The current working directory is the directory that you are currently in.

For example, if you are in the `/home/bard` directory, the `pwd` command will print `/home/bard`.

To use the `pwd` command, simply type `pwd` in the terminal.

Here is an example of the output of the `pwd` command:

```
/home/bard
```

This output indicates that the current working directory is `/home/bard`.

The `pwd` command is a very useful command for quickly finding out the current working directory. It can also be used to verify that you are in the correct directory before performing a command.



# help 

```
pwd: pwd [-LP]
    Print the name of the current working directory.
    
    Options:
      -L        print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
                directory
      -P        print the physical directory, without any symbolic links
    
```
