# cardmgr

The `cardmgr` command in Linux is used to control PC Cards and ExpressCards. PC Cards are credit card-sized devices that can be inserted into a PC Card slot on a laptop computer. ExpressCards are smaller than PC Cards and can be inserted into an ExpressCard slot on a laptop computer. PC Cards and ExpressCards can be used for a variety of purposes, including storage, networking, and communications.

The `cardmgr` command is used in the following syntax:

```
cardmgr [options] [command]
```

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-a` : List all PC Cards and ExpressCards.
* `-i` : Identify a PC Card or ExpressCard.
* `-m` : Modify the configuration of a PC Card or ExpressCard.
* `-r` : Remove a PC Card or ExpressCard.

The `command` can be used to perform the following tasks:

* `info` : Display information about a PC Card or ExpressCard.
* `insert` : Insert a PC Card or ExpressCard.
* `remove` : Remove a PC Card or ExpressCard.
* `status` : Display the status of a PC Card or ExpressCard.

For example, to list all PC Cards and ExpressCards, you would run the following command:

```
cardmgr -a
```

This command will list all PC Cards and ExpressCards that are currently inserted into the system.

To identify a PC Card or ExpressCard, you would run the following command:

```
cardmgr -i 0
```

This command will identify the PC Card or ExpressCard that is in slot 0.

To modify the configuration of a PC Card or ExpressCard, you would run the following command:

```
cardmgr -m 0
```

This command will modify the configuration of the PC Card or ExpressCard that is in slot 0.

To remove a PC Card or ExpressCard, you would run the following command:

```
cardmgr -r 0
```

This command will remove the PC Card or ExpressCard that is in slot 0.
