iconv is a command-line tool and a standardized application programming interface (API) used to convert between different character encodings. It can convert from any of these encodings to any other, through Unicode conversion.

The iconv command takes three arguments:

* The input file or standard input
* The output file or standard output
* The input and output character encodings

The input and output character encodings can be specified using a variety of formats, including:

* The name of the encoding
* The encoding's numeric code point
* A POSIX locale name

For example, to convert a file from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1, you would use the following command:

```
iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1 input.txt output.txt
```

You can also use iconv to convert text from standard input to standard output. To do this, you would omit the input and output file arguments. For example, to convert text from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1, you would use the following command:

```
iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1
```

iconv is a powerful tool that can be used to convert between different character encodings. It is a standard tool that is available on most Unix-like operating systems.

Here are some of the reasons why you might want to use iconv:

* To convert a file from one character encoding to another
* To convert text from standard input to standard output
* To convert text between different programming languages
* To troubleshoot character encoding problems

If you need to convert between different character encodings, then iconv is a great option. It is a powerful and versatile tool that is available on most Unix-like operating systems.
