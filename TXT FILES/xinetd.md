Xinetd is a daemon that manages Internet services. It is a replacement for inetd, which is a legacy daemon that is no longer recommended for use.

Xinetd is a more secure and flexible daemon than inetd. It can be used to control which services are available on a system, and it can be used to limit the access to those services.

Xinetd is started automatically when the system boots. It listens for incoming connections on a set of ports, and it then starts the appropriate service to handle the connection.

The services that Xinetd can manage include:

* Telnet
* FTP
* SSH
* HTTP
* HTTPS
* SMTP
* POP3
* IMAP
