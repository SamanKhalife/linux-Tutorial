# cksum

The `cksum` command in Linux is used to calculate and print the checksum of a file or a stream of data. A checksum is a value that is calculated from the contents of a file or a stream of data. It can be used to verify the integrity of the file or data, as well as to compare two files or streams of data to see if they are identical.

The `cksum` command is used in the following syntax:

```
cksum [options] file
```

The `file` is the file or stream of data that you want to calculate the checksum for.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-b` : Calculate the checksum for a block of data.
* `-c` : Compare the checksum of a file to the checksum of a file specified on the command line.
* `-w` : Calculate the checksum for a file with a specified word size.

For example, the following code will calculate the checksum for the file `file.txt`:

```
cksum file.txt
```

This code will print the checksum of the file `file.txt` to the standard output.

The `cksum` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to calculate and print the checksum of a file or a stream of data. It is a versatile command that can be used to verify the integrity of files, compare files, and more.
