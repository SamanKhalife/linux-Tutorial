# zforce

There is no such command as zforce in Linux. However, there is a command called unzip that can be used to extract files from a zip archive. The syntax for the unzip command is:

To list the contents of the zip archive my_archive.zip:
`unzip -l my_archive.zip`

To extract the files from the zip archive my_archive.zip to the directory /home/user/data:
`unzip -d /home/user/data my_archive.zip`

To extract the files from the zip archive my_archive.zip and overwrite existing files:
`unzip -f my_archive.zip`

# help 

```
-l, --list: This option lists the contents of the zip archive.
-d, --directory: This option specifies the directory where the files will be extracted.
-f, --force: This option overwrites existing files.
-h, --help: This option shows this help message.
```
