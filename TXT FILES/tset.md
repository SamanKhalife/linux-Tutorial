# tset

The test command in Linux is used to evaluate expressions and return a status code. The status code can be used to control the flow of a shell script.

The expression argument is the expression that you want to evaluate. The expression can be a simple comparison, such as a = b or a < b. It can also be a more complex expression, such as a - b > 0.

The test command returns a status code of 0 if the expression is true, and a status code of 1 if the expression is false.

For example, the following command will return a status code of 0 if the variable a is equal to the variable b:

`test a = b`

The following command will return a status code of 1 if the variable a is less than the variable b:

`test a < b`

The test command is a powerful tool that can be used to control the flow of a shell script. However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can be easy to make mistakes.
