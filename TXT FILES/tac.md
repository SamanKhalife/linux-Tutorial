The "tac" command in Linux is used to display the contents of a file in reverse order, line by line. It reads a file and prints its lines in reverse order, starting from the last line and moving upwards.

# help 

```
Usage: tac [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Write each FILE to standard output, last line first.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -b, --before             attach the separator before instead of after
  -r, --regex              interpret the separator as a regular expression
  -s, --separator=STRING   use STRING as the separator instead of newline
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

```
