The `e2label` command in Linux is used to set or display the label of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem. The label is a name that is assigned to a filesystem and can be used to identify it.

The `e2label` command is used in the following syntax:

```
e2label [options] device label
```

The `device` is the path to the device that contains the filesystem that you want to label.

The `label` is the new label for the filesystem.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-f` : Force overwriting the existing label.
* `-n` : Do not actually change the label, just print the new value.

For example, the following code will set the label of the ext4 filesystem on device `/dev/sda1` to `my_data`:

```
e2label /dev/sda1 my_data
```

This code will set the label of the ext4 filesystem on device `/dev/sda1` to `my_data`.

The following code will print the label of the ext4 filesystem on device `/dev/sda1` without actually changing it:

```
e2label -n /dev/sda1
```

This code will print the label of the ext4 filesystem on device `/dev/sda1` without actually changing it.

The `e2label` command is a simple and useful command that can be used to set or display the label of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem. It is a valuable command to know, especially if you need to identify or manage filesystems.
