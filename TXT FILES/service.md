# service

The `service` command in Linux is used to manage system services. It is a versatile command that can be used to start, stop, restart, enable, and disable services.

The `service` command is used in the following syntax:

```
service [options] [service_name] [action]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-q`: Quiet mode.
* `-s`: Suppresses the standard output.
* `-h`: Displays help.

The `service_name` is the name of the service that you want to manage.

The `action` is the action that you want to perform on the service. The available actions are:

* `start`: Starts the service.
* `stop`: Stops the service.
* `restart`: Restarts the service.
* `enable`: Enables the service to start automatically at boot time.
* `disable`: Disables the service from starting automatically at boot time.

For example, to start the service `sshd`, you would use the following command:

```
service sshd start
```

To stop the service `sshd`, you would use the following command:

```
service sshd stop
```

To restart the service `sshd`, you would use the following command:

```
service sshd restart
```

To enable the service `sshd` to start automatically at boot time, you would use the following command:

```
service sshd enable
```

To disable the service `sshd` from starting automatically at boot time, you would use the following command:

```
service sshd disable
```
