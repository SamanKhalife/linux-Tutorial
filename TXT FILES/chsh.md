# chsh

The `chsh` command in Linux is used to change the login shell for the current user. The login shell is the program that is executed when you log in to your Linux system.

The `chsh` command is used in the following syntax:

```
chsh [options] [shell]
```

The `shell` is the new login shell that you want to use.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-l` : List the available login shells.
* `-s` : Set the login shell to the specified shell.

For example, to change the login shell to the Bourne shell, you would run the following command:

```
chsh -s /bin/sh
```

This command will change the login shell to the Bourne shell.

To list the available login shells, you would run the following command:

```
chsh -l
```

This command will list all of the available login shells on your system.

The `chsh` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to change the login shell for the current user. It is a versatile command that can be used to change the login shell to any shell that is supported by your Linux system.

Here are some additional things to note about the `chsh` command:

* The `chsh` command can be used to change the login shell to any shell that is supported by your Linux system.
* The `chsh` command can be used to change the login shell for any user, not just the current user.
* The `chsh` command is a secure command that requires root privileges to change the login shell for another user.
