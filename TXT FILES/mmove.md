# mmove

The `mmove` command in Linux is used to move files from one directory to another. It is a more powerful alternative to the `mv` command, as it allows you to move multiple files at once and to specify the destination directory.

The syntax of the `mmove` command is as follows:

```
mmove [options] source-directory destination-directory
```

The `source-directory` argument specifies the directory that contains the files that you want to move.

The `destination-directory` argument specifies the directory that you want to move the files to.

The `options` argument specifies additional options for moving the files. The most common options are as follows:

* `-f`: Force the move, even if the destination directory already exists.
* `-i`: Interactive mode, which will prompt you to confirm each move.
* `-v`: Verbose mode, which will print more information about the move.

For example, the following command moves all files from the directory `/home/user/old_files` to the directory `/home/user/new_files`:

```
mmove /home/user/old_files /home/user/new_files
```

The `mmove` command is a useful tool for moving files from one directory to another. It is more powerful than the `mv` command and can be used to move multiple files at once.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `mmove` command:

* The `mmove` command can only be used to move files within the same file system.
* The `mmove` command will not overwrite existing files in the destination directory.
* The `mmove` command can be used to move files to a remote directory.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `mmove` command, so that you do not accidentally overwrite files or move files to an incorrect directory.
