# rwho

The `rwho` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to get information about who is logged on to the system. It is a versatile command that can be used to get information about a variety of things, including:

* The name of the user.
* The IP address of the system.
* The time the user logged on.
* The time the user is scheduled to log off.

The `rwho` command is used in the following syntax:

```
rwho
```

The `rwho` command will broadcast a message to the network, asking for information about who is logged on to the system. Other computers on the network can listen for these messages and use them to get information about who is logged on to the system.

The `rwho` command is no longer recommended for use. It is a legacy protocol that is not secure. Instead, you should use the `whois` command to get information about who is logged on to a remote system.

The `whois` command is used to get information about a user or system on the network. It is a versatile command that can be used to get information about a variety of things, including:

* The name of the user.
* The IP address of the system.
* The time the user logged on.
* The time the user is scheduled to log off.
* The operating system of the system.

The `whois` command is used in the following syntax:

```
whois [options] [username] [hostname]
```

The `username` is the name of the user to get information about.

The `hostname` is the name of the system to get information about.

For example, to get information about the user `root` on the system `example.com`, you would use the following command:

```
whois root example.com
```

This command will return information about the user `root` on the system `example.com`, including the name of the user, the IP address of the system, the time the user logged on, and the time the user is scheduled to log off.

The `whois` command is a powerful tool that can be used to get information about a variety of things on the network. It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the benefits of using `whois`:

* It is a secure way to get information about a user or system on the network.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.
* It is a free and open-source software.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `whois`:

* It can be difficult to interpret the output of the command.
* It can be slow to get information about a user or system on a large network.

The `whois` command is a powerful tool that can be used to get information about a variety of things on the network. However, it is important to use it carefully and to understand the potential risks before you use it.
