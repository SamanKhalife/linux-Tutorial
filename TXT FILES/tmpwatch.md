The `tmpwatch` command is a command-line utility that can be used to automatically remove temporary files that have not been accessed for a specified period of time. It is a useful tool for system administrators who want to keep their systems clean and free of unnecessary files.

The `tmpwatch` command is used as follows:

```
tmpwatch [options] [directory]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `tmpwatch` command.
* `directory`: This is the directory that you want to monitor for temporary files.

For example, the following command will remove temporary files in the directory `/tmp` that have not been accessed for 7 days:

```
tmpwatch -d /tmp 7
```

The `tmpwatch` command will recursively search the directory `/tmp` for temporary files. Any files that have not been accessed for 7 days will be deleted.
