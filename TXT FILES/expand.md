The expand command in Linux is used to expand tabs in a file. It can be used to make a file more readable by replacing tabs with spaces.

For example, the following command will expand the tabs in the file file.txt and write the output to the file expanded.txt:

`expand file.txt > expanded.txt`






# help 

```

-t, --tabs=NUMBER   Set the number of spaces to use for each tab.

```
