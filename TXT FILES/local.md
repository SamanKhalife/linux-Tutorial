The local keyword in Linux is used to declare a local variable. Local variables are variables that are only visible within the current function or scope. This means that they cannot be accessed from other functions or scopes.

To search for all files that contain the word "hello":
locate hello

To search for all files that contain the word "hello" in the current directory:
locate -b . hello

To search for all files that contain the word "hello" and ignore case:
locate -i hello

To search for all files that contain the word "hello" recursively:
locate -r hello

# help
