The local keyword in Linux is used to declare a local variable. Local variables are variables that are only visible within the current function or scope. This means that they cannot be accessed from other functions or scopes.


The syntax for the local keyword is:

`local variable_name`

For example, the following code declares a local variable called my_variable:

`local my_variable`

The my_variable variable can only be accessed within the current function. If you try to access it from another function, you will get an error.

Local variables are a useful way to keep track of data that is only needed within a specific function. They can also be used to prevent name collisions between variables in different functions.
