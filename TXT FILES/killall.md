The `killall` command in Linux is used to terminate all processes that match a given name. The `killall` command is a powerful tool that can be used to terminate multiple processes at once.

The syntax for the `killall` command is as follows:

```
killall [options] name
```

The `name` argument is the name of the process that you want to terminate.

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `killall` command.

Here are some of the most useful `killall` options:

* `-9`: Send a SIGKILL signal to all processes that match the name.
* `-s`: Specify the signal to send to all processes that match the name.
* `-l`: List all the available signals.
* `-i`: Interactive mode.
* `-q`: Quiet mode.

Here is an example of how to use the `killall` command to terminate all processes that match the name `firefox`:

```
killall firefox
```

This command will send a SIGKILL signal to all processes that match the name `firefox`. All Firefox processes will be terminated immediately.

Here is an example of how to use the `killall` command to terminate all processes that match the name `firefox` using a signal of your choice:

```
killall -s SIGTERM firefox
```

This command will send a SIGTERM signal to all processes that match the name `firefox`. All Firefox processes will be terminated gracefully.

The `killall` command is a powerful tool for terminating processes. It can be used to terminate multiple processes at once, and it can be used to terminate processes that are not responding.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `killall` command:
