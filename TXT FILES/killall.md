# killall

The `killall` command in Unix and Linux is used to terminate processes by name rather than by process ID (PID). It sends signals to all processes that match the specified process name, effectively terminating them. Hereâ€™s how you can use `killall`:

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for the `killall` command is:

```sh
killall [options] process_name
```

- **`process_name`**: The name of the process or processes you want to terminate.
- **`options`**: Optional flags to modify the behavior of `killall`.

### Examples

#### Kill a Single Process

To kill all instances of a process named `firefox`:

```sh
killall firefox
```

- This command sends the default signal (SIGTERM) to all processes named `firefox`, asking them to terminate gracefully.

#### Forcefully Terminate Processes

To forcefully terminate all instances of a process named `java`:

```sh
killall -9 java
```

- The `-9` option sends the SIGKILL signal, which forcefully terminates the `java` processes without allowing them to clean up resources.

#### Verbose Mode

To display verbose output while killing processes:

```sh
killall -v chrome
```

- The `-v` option (verbose mode) prints a message for each process killed.

### Options

#### `-e`

- Ensures that the processes belong to the same effective user ID as the caller.

#### `-g`

- Kills the process group to which the process belongs.

#### `-i`

- Interactively asks for confirmation before killing each process.

#### `-q`

- Quiet mode. Suppresses all messages.

#### `-r`

- Restricts the name matching to the specified regular expression pattern.

### Practical Use Cases

#### Terminating Problematic Processes

Use `killall` to terminate misbehaving or stuck processes that are consuming system resources.

#### Automating Process Management

In scripts or automated tasks, `killall` can be used to ensure specific processes are terminated before starting a new task.

#### System Maintenance

During system maintenance or cleanup tasks, `killall` helps to ensure that all instances of certain processes are stopped as needed.

### Caution

- **Be cautious when using `killall`**, especially with the `-9` option (`SIGKILL`), as it forcefully terminates processes without allowing them to clean up resources. This can lead to data loss or corruption in some cases.
- **Ensure you specify the correct process name** to avoid unintended termination of critical processes.

### Summary

The `killall` command is a convenient tool for terminating processes by name in Unix and Linux systems. It simplifies the process of managing and stopping multiple instances of a specific process, offering various options for customization and control. Understanding its usage and options ensures effective process management and system maintenance.
