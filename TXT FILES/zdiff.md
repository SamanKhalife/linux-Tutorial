There is no such command as zdiff in Linux. However, there is a command called diff that can be used to compare two files.

Here are some examples of how to use the diff command:

To compare the files file1.txt and file2.txt:
`diff file1.txt file2.txt`

To show the context of the differences between the files file1.txt and file2.txt:
`diff -c file1.txt file2.txt`

To show help for the diff command:
`diff --help`

# help 

```
-b, --brief: This option suppresses all but the most significant differences.
-c, --context: This option shows the context of the differences.
-h, --help: This option shows this help message.
```
