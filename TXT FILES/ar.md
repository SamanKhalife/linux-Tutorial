Sure, here is the English version of the `ar` command:

The `ar` command is used to create and extract archives. An archive is a collection of files bundled into a single file. Archives can be used to easily transfer and store files.

The `ar` command has the following options:

* `c`: Creates an archive.
* `t`: Lists the contents of an archive.
* `x`: Extracts files from an archive.
* `v`: Lists the contents of an archive in verbose mode.
* `d`: Deletes files from an archive.

To use the `ar` command, you type the following:

```
ar [options] [archive name] [file name]
```

For example, the following command creates an archive called `myarchive.tar` and adds the files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to the archive:

```
ar r myarchive.tar file1.txt file2.txt
```

The following command lists the contents of the archive `myarchive.tar`:

```
ar t myarchive.tar
```

The following command extracts the file `file1.txt` from the archive `myarchive.tar`:

```
ar x myarchive.tar file1.txt
```

The following command deletes the file `file2.txt` from the archive `myarchive.tar`:

```
ar d myarchive.tar file2.txt
```

The `ar` command is a useful command for creating and extracting archives. Archives can be used to easily transfer and store files.
