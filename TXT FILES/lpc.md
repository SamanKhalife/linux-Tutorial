The "lpc" command in Linux is a tool used to control and manage line printer devices connected to the system. "lpc" stands for "Line Printer Control." This command allows you to send print jobs to printers, manage print queues, and monitor the status of print jobs.

To use "lpc," you can access its command-line interface by running the "lpc" command in the terminal. From there, you can issue various commands to manage print queues and control print jobs. The specific commands available within "lpc" and their functionality can vary depending on the system and printer configuration.
