The gzexe command is a Linux command that can be used to compress executable files. It does this by compressing the file with the gzip compression algorithm and then adding a shell script that will decompress the file and execute it.

The gzexe command is a powerful tool that can be used to compress executable files. It is a simple command to use, but it can be very effective.

However, it is important to note that gzexe is a security risk, as it can be used to create malicious executable files.
