Sure, I can help you with that.

The `popd` command in Linux is used to move to the previous directory in the directory stack. This command is used to manipulate the directory stack, which is a list of recently accessed directories. You can use the `pushd` command to add a directory to the stack and the `popd` command to remove a directory from the stack.

The syntax for the `popd` command is as follows:

```
popd
```

This command moves to the previous directory in the directory stack.

Here is an example of how to use the `popd` command:

```
$ cd /home/user
$ pwd
/home/user
$ pushd /tmp
$ pwd
/tmp
$ popd
$ pwd
/home/user
```

In the first command, the current directory is moved to /home/user. The next command outputs the path of the current directory. The next command adds the /tmp directory to the stack. The next command moves the current directory to /tmp. The next command removes the directory from the stack. The next command outputs the path of the current directory.

The `popd` command is a useful tool for manipulating the directory stack.
