The `fc-list` command in Linux is used to list the available fonts. It is a powerful tool that can be used to find fonts that are installed on your system and to select fonts for use in applications.

The `fc-list` command is used in the following syntax:

```
fc-list [options] [pattern]
```

The `pattern` is an optional argument that can be used to filter the list of fonts. The pattern can be a font name, a font family, or a font style.

For example, the following code will list all of the fonts that are installed on the system:

```
fc-list
```

This code will list all of the fonts that are installed on the system, including their names, families, and styles.
