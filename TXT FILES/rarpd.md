The rarpd command is a daemon that responds to RARP requests. RARP is a protocol that is used to resolve Ethernet addresses to IP addresses.

The rarpd command is typically used in conjunction with a DHCP server. The DHCP server will assign IP addresses to clients, and rarpd will then respond to RARP requests from those clients.
