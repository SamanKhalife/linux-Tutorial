The `chkconfig` command in Linux is used to manage the startup and shutdown of services. It is a powerful tool that can be used to control which services are started at boot time, and which services are stopped when the system is shut down.

The `chkconfig` command is used in the following syntax:

```
chkconfig [options] service [on|off|reset|ask]
```

The `service` is the name of the service that you want to manage.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-a` : Show all services.
* `-l` : List the current runlevels.
* `-s` : Set the startup level.

For example, the following code will set the startup level for the `sshd` service to `3`.

```
chkconfig sshd 3
```

This code will ensure that the `sshd` service is started in runlevel `3`, which is the default runlevel for most Linux distributions.

The `chkconfig` command is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to control the startup and shutdown of services. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used by system administrators to manage a variety of services.

Here are some additional things to note about the `chkconfig` command:

* The `chkconfig` command can be used to manage any service.
