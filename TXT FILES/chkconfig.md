# chkconfig

The `chkconfig` command in Linux is used to manage services and their runlevels. It is primarily associated with systems using the SysV init system, which is common in older Linux distributions. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how `chkconfig` works and its usage:

### Purpose of `chkconfig`

1. **Service Management**:
   - `chkconfig` allows system administrators to configure services to start or stop automatically at various runlevels during system startup or shutdown.

2. **Runlevels**:
   - Runlevels represent different states of the system, such as single-user mode, multi-user mode with networking, and shutdown.
   - Each runlevel can have specific services configured to start or stop automatically.

### Usage Examples

- **Viewing Service Status**:
  - To see the status of a service and its runlevel configuration:

    ```bash
    chkconfig --list <service_name>
    ```

    This command lists the runlevels at which `<service_name>` is configured to start (`on`) or not start (`off`).

- **Enabling a Service**:
  - To enable a service to start automatically at specific runlevels:

    ```bash
    chkconfig <service_name> on
    ```

    This command configures `<service_name>` to start at the default runlevels defined in its init script.

- **Disabling a Service**:
  - To disable automatic startup of a service:

    ```bash
    chkconfig <service_name> off
    ```

    This command prevents `<service_name>` from starting automatically at any runlevel.

- **Setting Default Runlevels**:
  - Administrators can specify the default runlevels for starting and stopping a service:

    ```bash
    chkconfig --level <runlevel> <service_name> on
    chkconfig --level <runlevel> <service_name> off
    ```

    Replace `<runlevel>` with the desired runlevel (e.g., `3`, `5`) and `<service_name>` with the name of the service.

### `chkconfig` with `systemd`

- **Compatibility**:
  - While `chkconfig` is associated with SysV init, some Linux distributions may provide compatibility layers for `chkconfig` to manage `systemd` services.
  - However, `systemctl` is the preferred command for managing `systemd` services (`systemctl enable`, `systemctl start`, etc.).

### Conclusion

Understanding `chkconfig` is essential for managing services in Linux distributions that use the SysV init system. It provides a straightforward way to configure services to start or stop automatically at different runlevels. As Linux evolves, `systemd` has largely replaced SysV init, but `chkconfig` remains relevant in legacy environments and for systems maintaining SysV compatibility. For modern `systemd`-based systems, administrators should use `systemctl` commands for service management.
