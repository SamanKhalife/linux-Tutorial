# break


The `break` command in Linux is used to exit a loop from within the loop. This is useful if you want to exit a loop early, for example if you find the condition that you are testing for is met.

The `break` command is used in the following syntax:

```
break [n]
```

The `n` is optional and specifies the number of loops to skip before exiting. If `n` is not specified, the `break` command will exit the current loop.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but will exit the loop after printing the number 5:

```
for i in {1..10}
do
  echo $i
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    break
  fi
done
```

This code will print the following output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

The `break` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to exit a loop from within the loop. It is a versatile command that can be used in a variety of contexts.

Here are some additional things to note about the `break` command:

* The `break` command can be used to exit any type of loop, including for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.
* The `break` command can be used to exit the current loop, or to skip a specified number of loops.
* The `break` command is a simple and easy-to-use command.
