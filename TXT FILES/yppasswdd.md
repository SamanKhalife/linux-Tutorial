Yes, the `yppasswdd` command is a daemon that is used to change passwords on NIS servers. NIS is a service that provides a central repository for storing user and group information.

The `yppasswdd` daemon is started automatically when the system boots. It can be stopped and started using the following commands:

```
systemctl stop yppasswdd
systemctl start yppasswdd
```

The `yppasswdd` daemon listens on port 1023 for requests to change passwords. When a request is received, the `yppasswdd` daemon will authenticate the user and then change their password in the NIS database.

The `yppasswdd` daemon is a valuable tool for changing passwords on NIS servers. It is especially useful for systems with a large number of users, as it can automate the password change process.

Here are some of the benefits of using `yppasswdd`:

* It is a secure way to change passwords, as the passwords are not transmitted over the network in clear text.
* It is a reliable way to change passwords, as the password change process is automated.
* It is a scalable way to change passwords, as it can handle a large number of requests simultaneously.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `yppasswdd`:

* It requires a NIS server to be set up.
* It is not as flexible as some other methods of changing passwords, such as using `passwd`.
* It can be difficult to troubleshoot if there are problems with the `yppasswdd` daemon.
