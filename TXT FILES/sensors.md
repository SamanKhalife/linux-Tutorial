The sensors command is a Linux command that can be used to display information about the sensors on your system. It is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor your system's temperature, voltage, fan speed, and other parameters.

The sensors command is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor your system's sensors. It is a simple command to use, but it can be very effective.


Here are some of the sensors that you can monitor with the sensors command:

- CPU temperature
- Motherboard temperature
- GPU temperature
- Hard drive temperature
- Fan speed
- Voltage
- Current
- Power

If you are concerned about the health of your system, you can use the sensors command to monitor your sensors. If you see any abnormal readings, you may need to take action to troubleshoot the problem.

# help 

```
sensors [options]

Display hardware sensor information.

Options:

-h, --help        show this help message
-a, --all          display all sensors, including those that are not in use
-r, --raw          display sensor readings in raw format
-d, --deci         display sensor readings in decimal format
-u, --units        show units after each sensor reading
--noupdate       do not update sensor readings before displaying them
--nocheck        do not check for new kernel modules
--version        print version information

For more information, see the sensors man page.
