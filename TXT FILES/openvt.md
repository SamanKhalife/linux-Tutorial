# openvt

The `openvt` command in Linux is used to open a new virtual terminal (VT). A VT is a logical terminal that can be used to run a command or application.

The syntax for the `openvt` command is as follows:

```
openvt [options] command
```

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `openvt` command.

Some of the most useful `openvt` options include:

* `-c`: Specify the VT number to use.
* `-l`: Make the command a login shell.
* `-s`: Switch to the new VT when the command is started.
* `-u`: Run the command as the specified user.

Here is an example of how to use the `openvt` command to open a new VT and run the `bash` command:

```
openvt bash
```

This command will open a new VT and run the `bash` command in that VT. The `bash` command will be started in the current directory.

Here is an example of how to use the `openvt` command to open a new VT and run the `ls` command in the `/tmp` directory:

```
openvt -c 10 ls /tmp
```

This command will open a new VT and run the `ls` command in the `/tmp` directory. The `ls` command will be started in the `/tmp` directory.

The `openvt` command is a useful tool for managing virtual terminals. You can use it to open new VTs to run different commands or applications.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `openvt` command:

* It can be used to open new VTs to run different commands or applications.
* It can be used to multiplex the use of a single physical terminal.
* It can be used to troubleshoot problems with VTs.
* It can be used to create custom VT configurations.
