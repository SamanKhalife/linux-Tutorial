# until

The `until` keyword in Bash is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The syntax for the `until` keyword is as follows:

```
until condition; do
    commands
done
```

The `condition` is a Boolean expression that must evaluate to `false` for the block of code to be executed repeatedly. The `commands` are the commands that will be executed repeatedly.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but will stop if the number is equal to 5:

```
i=1

until [ $i -eq 5 ]; do
    echo $i
    i=$((i+1))
done
```

The `until` keyword is a powerful tool that can be used to automate repetitive tasks. It can also be used to test for certain conditions.

Here are some other examples of how the `until` keyword can be used:

* To print the numbers from 1 to 100, but to skip any numbers that are divisible by 5:

```
i=1

until [ $i -eq 100 ]; do
    if [ $((i % 5)) -ne 0 ]; then
        echo $i
    fi
    i=$((i+1))
done
```

* To check if a file exists:

```
file_name="myfile.txt"

until [ -f $file_name ]; do
    echo "The file does not exist yet."
    sleep 1
done

echo "The file now exists."
```

The `until` keyword is a versatile tool that can be used to automate repetitive tasks and to test for certain conditions. It is a valuable tool for any Bash script.
