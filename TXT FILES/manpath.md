The `manpath` command in Linux is used to display the search path for manual pages. The search path is a colon-separated list of directories that the `man` command will search for manual pages.

The `manpath` command takes no arguments.

The following is an example of the output of the `manpath` command:

```
/usr/share/man:/usr/local/share/man
```

This output indicates that the `man` command will search for manual pages in the directories `/usr/share/man` and `/usr/local/share/man`.

The `manpath` command is a useful tool for troubleshooting problems with the `man` command. If you are unable to find a manual page, you can use the `manpath` command to see if the manual page is located in the search path.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `manpath` command:

* The `manpath` command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to view the search path.
* The `manpath` command can only be used to display the search path for the current user.
* The `manpath` command cannot be used to display the search path for a different user.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `manpath` command, so that you do not accidentally view information that you do not have permission to see.

Here are some examples of how to use the `manpath` command:

* To display the search path for the current user:
```
manpath
```
* To display the search path for a different user:
```
manpath -u <username>
```
