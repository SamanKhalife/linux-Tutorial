GDB is a powerful debugger that can be used to find and fix bugs in your programs. It can be used to start your program, specify anything that might affect its behavior, make your program stop on specified conditions, examine what has happened, when your program has stopped, and change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

To start GDB, you can run the following command:

```
gdb <program>
```

For example, to start GDB and debug the program `hello_world.c`, you would run the following command:

```
gdb hello_world
```

Once GDB is started, you can use the following commands to debug your program:

* `b <line number>`: Set a breakpoint at the specified line number.
* `c`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint is hit.
* `n`: Execute the next line of code.
* `p <variable>`: Print the value of the specified variable.
* `s`: Step into the next function call.
* `f`: Step over the next function call.
* `q`: Quit GDB.

For more information on GDB commands, you can consult the GDB documentation: https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/.

Here are some examples of how you can use GDB to debug your programs:

* To set a breakpoint at the beginning of the `main()` function, you would use the following command:

```
b main
```

* To continue execution until the breakpoint is hit, you would use the following command:

```
c
```

* To print the value of the variable `x`, you would use the following command:

```
p x
```

* To step into the next function call, you would use the following command:

```
s
```

* To step over the next function call, you would use the following command:

```
f
```

* To quit GDB, you would use the following command:

```
q
```
