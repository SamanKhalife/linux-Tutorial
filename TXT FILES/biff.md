# biff

The `biff` command in Linux is used to control whether or not the system will notify you when you receive new mail. By default, the `biff` command is enabled, so you will be notified when you receive new mail.

The `biff` command is used in the following syntax:

```
biff [options]
```

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-y` : Enable biff.
* `-n` : Disable biff.
* `-r` : Ignore unread mail notifications.

For example, to enable biff, you would run the following command:

```
biff -y
```

This command will enable biff, so you will be notified when you receive new mail.

To disable biff, you would run the following command:

```
biff -n
```

This command will disable biff, so you will not be notified when you receive new mail.

To ignore unread mail notifications, you would run the following command:

```
biff -r
```

This command will ignore unread mail notifications, so you will not be notified when you receive new mail, even if biff is enabled.

The `biff` command is a useful tool that can be used to keep you informed of new mail. It can be helpful to disable biff when you are working on something that requires your full attention, or when you want to avoid distractions.

Here are some additional things to note about the `biff` command:

* The `biff` command is a part of the mailutils package.
* The `biff` command can be used on any system that uses the Linux kernel.
* The `biff` command can be used to control whether or not you are notified when you receive new mail in any mail user agent (MUA).
* The `biff` command can be used to ignore unread mail notifications, which can be helpful when you are working on something that requires your full attention, or when you want to avoid distractions.
