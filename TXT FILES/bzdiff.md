# bzdiff 

The `bzdiff` command in Linux is a tool that can be used to compare two bzip2 compressed files. It is a powerful tool that can be used to find differences between two files.

The `bzdiff` command is used in the following syntax:

```
bzdiff [options] file1 file2
```

The `file1` and `file2` are the two bzip2 compressed files that you want to compare.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-d` : Display the differences in diff format.

For example, the following code will compare the two bzip2 compressed files `file1.bz2` and `file2.bz2` and will display the differences in context:

```
bzdiff -c file1.bz2 file2.bz2
```

This code will print the following output:

```
1c1
< This is line 1 in file1.
---
> This is line 1 in file2.
```
