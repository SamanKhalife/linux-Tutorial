# cfdisk

Cfdisk is a command-line partitioning tool for Linux. It is a curses-based program, which means that it uses a text-based user interface that is easy to use. Cfdisk can be used to create, delete, and modify partitions on hard disks, floppy disks, and USB drives.

To use cfdisk, you first need to open a terminal window and type the following command:

```
cfdisk /dev/sdX
```

where `/dev/sdX` is the device name of the disk that you want to partition.

Cfdisk will then open a graphical user interface that displays the current partition table for the disk. You can use the mouse or the keyboard to navigate the interface.

To create a new partition, click on the free space in the partition table and then press the `n` key. You will be prompted to enter the size of the partition and the type of partition.

To delete a partition, click on the partition that you want to delete and then press the `d` key.

To modify the properties of a partition, click on the partition and then press the `m` key. You will be able to change the size, type, and mount point of the partition.

When you are finished partitioning the disk, press the `w` key to write the changes to the partition table.

Cfdisk is a powerful and versatile partitioning tool that can be used to create and manage partitions on hard disks, floppy disks, and USB drives. It is a simple and easy-to-use tool that is perfect for beginners and experienced users alike.
