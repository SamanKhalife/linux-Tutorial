# mlabel

The `mlabel` command in Linux is used to create and manage volume labels on magnetic disks. It is a powerful command that can be used to make sure that your disks are labeled correctly and that the labels are readable by other systems.

The syntax of the `mlabel` command is as follows:

```
mlabel [options] device [label]
```

The `device` argument specifies the device that you want to label.

The `label` argument specifies the label that you want to create. If you do not specify the `label` argument, the `mlabel` command will prompt you to enter a label.

For example, the following command will create a volume label named "my-disk" on the device `/dev/sda`:

```
mlabel /dev/sda my-disk
```

This command will create a volume label named "my-disk" on the device `/dev/sda`.

The `mlabel` command is a powerful command that can be used to make sure that your disks are labeled correctly and that the labels are readable by other systems.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `mlabel` command:

* The `mlabel` command can only be used to label disks that are formatted with the ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.
* The `mlabel` command will not allow you to create a volume label that is longer than 16 characters.
* The `mlabel` command will not allow you to create a volume label that contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `mlabel` command, so that you do not create a volume label that is invalid.
