# setfdprm

The `setfdprm` command in Linux is used to set the parameters for a floppy disk. It is a versatile command that can be used to change the geometry, speed, and other parameters of a floppy disk.

The `setfdprm` command is used in the following syntax:

```
setfdprm [options] [device]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-h`: Sets the head number.
* `-s`: Sets the sector number.
* `-c`: Sets the cylinder number.
* `-t`: Sets the transfer rate.
* `-f`: Sets the floppy disk format.

The `device` specifies the floppy disk that you want to change the parameters for.

For example, to set the head number for a floppy disk to 0, you would use the following command:

```
setfdprm -h 0 /dev/fd0
```

To set the sector number for a floppy disk to 10, you would use the following command:

```
setfdprm -s 10 /dev/fd0
```

To set the cylinder number for a floppy disk to 20, you would use the following command:

```
setfdprm -c 20 /dev/fd0
```

To set the transfer rate for a floppy disk to 500Kbps, you would use the following command:

```
setfdprm -t 500 /dev/fd0
```

To set the floppy disk format for a floppy disk to 1.44MB, you would use the following command:

```
setfdprm -f 1.44 /dev/fd0
```
