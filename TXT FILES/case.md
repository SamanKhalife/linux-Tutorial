The `case` command in Linux is a conditional statement that can be used to select from a set of possible values. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make decisions based on the value of a variable.

The `case` command is used in the following syntax:

```
case variable in
  pattern1)
    command1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    command2
    ;;
  *)
    default_command
    ;;
esac
```

The `variable` is the variable that you want to test.

The `pattern1`, `pattern2`, and `*` are patterns that you want to match against the value of the variable.

The `command1`, `command2`, and `default_command` are the commands that you want to run if the variable matches the pattern.

For example, the following code will print the day of the week if the variable `day` is set to `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, or `Sunday`:

```
day="Monday"

case $day in
  "Monday")
    echo "The day is Monday."
    ;;
  "Tuesday")
    echo "The day is Tuesday."
    ;;
  "Wednesday")
    echo "The day is Wednesday."
    ;;
  "Thursday")
    echo "The day is Thursday."
    ;;
  "Friday")
    echo "The day is Friday."
    ;;
  "Saturday")
    echo "The day is Saturday."
    ;;
  "Sunday")
    echo "The day is Sunday."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "The day is not set."
    ;;
esac
```

This code will print the following output:

```
The day is Monday.
```
