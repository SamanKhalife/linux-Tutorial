# 

The exec command is used to replace the current shell with a new shell or program. It is typically used to start a new program or to change to a different shell.

to start the vim editor, you would use the following command:

`exec vim`

To change to the bash shell, you would use the following command:

`exec bash`


# help 

```
exec: exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [argument ...]] [redirection ...]
    Replace the shell with the given command.
    
    Execute COMMAND, replacing this shell with the specified program.
    ARGUMENTS become the arguments to COMMAND.  If COMMAND is not specified,
    any redirections take effect in the current shell.
    
    Options:
      -a name   pass NAME as the zeroth argument to COMMAND
      -c        execute COMMAND with an empty environment
      -l        place a dash in the zeroth argument to COMMAND
    

```
