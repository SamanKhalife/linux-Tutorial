The `export` command in Linux is used to make a variable available to child processes and subshells. This means that the variable can be used in the current shell and in any child processes that are created from the current shell.

The `export` command is used in the following syntax:

```
export [variable]
```

The `variable` is the name of the variable that you want to export.

For example, the following code will export the variable `name` to the child processes and subshells:

```
export name=johndoe
```

This code will make the variable `name` available to the child processes and subshells. The variable `name` can then be used in the current shell and in any child processes that are created from the current shell.

The `export` command is a simple and useful command that can be used to share variables between processes and shells. It is a valuable command to know, especially if you use shell scripts or if you frequently create child processes.

Here are some additional things to note about the `export` command:

* The `export` command can be used to export any variable.
* The `export` command can be used to export variables to the current shell and to child processes and subshells.
* The `export` command is a simple and useful command.
