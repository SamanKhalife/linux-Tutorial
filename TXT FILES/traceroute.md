The traceroute command is used to trace the route that a packet takes from your computer to a destination. This can be useful for troubleshooting network problems, as it can help you to identify which routers or gateways are causing delays or packet loss.

For example, to trace the route to the website www.google.com, you would use the following command:

`traceroute www.google.com`

The traceroute command will output a list of the routers or gateways that the packet passed through on its way to the destination. It will also show the round-trip time (RTT) for each hop.

Arguments:

      packetlen     The full packet length (default is the length of an IP
                    header plus 40). Can be ignored or increased to a minimal
                    allowed value
```



## breakdown

```
-h, --help: This option shows this help message.
-m, --maxhops=NUMBER: This option sets the maximum number of hops. The default is 30.
-n, --noresolve: This option does not resolve hostnames. This means that the traceroute command will only show the IP addresses of the routers or gateways.
-q, --quiet: This option does not print as much output. This can be useful if you are tracing a large number of hops.
-t, --ttl=NUMBER: This option sets the Time To Live (TTL) value. The TTL is a number that is decremented by each router or gateway that the packet passes through. When the TTL reaches 0, the packet is discarded.
-v, --verbose: This option prints more detailed output. This includes the IP address of each router or gateway, as well as the RTT for each hop.
