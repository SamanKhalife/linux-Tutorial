Sure, the lsattr command is a Linux command that can be used to list the attributes of files and directories. It is a simple command to use, but it can be very effective.

Here are some examples of how to use the lsattr command:

To list the attributes of the file file.txt:
`lsattr file.txt`

To list the attributes of all of the files in the current directory recursively:
`lsattr -R`

To list all of the attributes of the file file.txt, including those that are not normally displayed:
`lsattr -a file.txt`

To list the attributes of the file file.txt in a human-readable format:
`lsattr -h file.txt`

# help 

```
lsattr [options] [files]

List file attributes.

Options:

-R, --recursive   List attributes recursively.
-a, --all         List all attributes.
-h, --human       Print attributes in human-readable format.
-l, --long        Print all attributes, including those that are not normally displayed.
-V, --verbose     Print more verbose information.
