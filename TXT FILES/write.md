The `write` command is a command-line utility that can be used to send a message to another user on the same system. It is a simple and easy-to-use command, but it is not as secure as some other methods of sending messages.

The `write` command is used as follows:

```
write [username] [message]
```

* `username`: This is the username of the user that you want to send the message to.
* `message`: This is the message that you want to send.

For example, the following command sends the message "Hello!" to the user `bob`:

```
write bob Hello!
```
