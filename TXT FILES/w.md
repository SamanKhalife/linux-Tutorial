The `w` command is a Linux command that displays information about users who are currently logged in to the system. It is a versatile command that can be used to quickly get a snapshot of who is logged in and what they are doing.

The `w` command is used as follows:

```
w
```

The `w` command will display the following information about each user who is logged in:

* Username: The username of the user.
* Terminal: The terminal that the user is logged into.
* PID: The process ID of the user's shell.
* Time: The time that the user logged in.
* Idle: The amount of time that the user has been idle.
* What: The command that the user is currently running.

For example, the following output from the `w` command shows that the user `johndoe` is logged into the terminal `tty1` and has been idle for 2 minutes. The user is currently running the command `vim`.

```
$ w

 13:58:35 up 4 days, 3:42,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
johndoe   tty1     pts/0            13:56    2m    0.09s  0.09s vim
```

The `w` command is a valuable tool for system administrators who need to monitor the activity of users on their system. It can also be used by users to see who else is logged in and what they are doing.
