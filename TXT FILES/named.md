# named

The `named` command in Linux is used to start, stop, and restart the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND). BIND is a software application that translates domain names into IP addresses.

The syntax of the `named` command is as follows:

```
named [options]
```

The `options` argument specifies additional options for starting, stopping, or restarting BIND. The most common options are as follows:

* `-c`: Specifies the configuration file to use.
* `-d`: Runs BIND in the foreground.
* `-f`: Forces BIND to reload its configuration file.
* `-s`: Specifies the directory where the BIND logs are stored.

For example, the following command starts BIND using the configuration file `/etc/named.conf`:

```
named -c /etc/named.conf
```

The `named` command is a powerful tool for managing your DNS server. It can be used to start, stop, and restart BIND, as well as to configure BIND.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `named` command:

* The `named` command must be run as root.
* The `named` command can only be used to manage BIND servers that are running on your system.
* The `named` command does not create or delete DNS zones.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `named` command, so that you do not accidentally manage a DNS server that is not on your system or make changes to DNS zones that you do not intend to make.
