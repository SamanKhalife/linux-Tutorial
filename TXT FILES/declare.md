# declare
The `declare` command in Linux is used to declare variables and set their attributes. It is a builtin command in the Bash shell.

The `declare` command is used in the following syntax:

```
declare [options] name [value]
```

The `name` is the name of the variable that you want to declare.

The `value` is the value of the variable.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-a` : The variable is an array.
* `-i` : The variable is an integer.
* `-f` : The variable is a function.
* `-r` : The variable is read-only.
* `-x` : The variable is exported.

For example, the following code will declare a variable named `name` and set its value to `John Doe`:

```
declare name="John Doe"
```

This code will create a variable named `name` and set its value to `John Doe`.

The `declare` command is a simple and useful command that can be used to declare variables and set their attributes. It is a valuable command to know, especially if you use shell scripts or if you frequently use variables in the Bash shell.
