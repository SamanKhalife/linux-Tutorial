The `screen` command in Linux is a terminal multiplexer. It is a versatile command that can be used to run multiple terminals in one window, detach and reattach to terminals, and create virtual screens.

The `screen` command is used in the following syntax:

```
screen [options]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-d`: Detach from the current screen.
* `-r`: Reattach to a detached screen.
* `-S`: Specifies the name of the screen to create.
* `-h`: Displays help.

For example, to create a new screen called `myscreen`, you would use the following command:

```
screen -S myscreen
```

This command will create a new screen called `myscreen`. You can then start any commands in the new screen.

To detach from the current screen, you would use the following command:

```
Ctrl+a d
```

This command will detach you from the current screen. You can then reattach to the screen by using the following command:

```
screen -r myscreen
```

This command will reattach you to the screen called `myscreen`.

The `screen` command is a powerful tool that can be used to manage multiple terminals. It is supported by most Linux distributions.
