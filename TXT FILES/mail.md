The mail command is a Linux command that can be used to send and receive email. It is a simple command to use, but it can be very effective.

Here are some examples of how to use the mail command:


```
# To send an email to the address `user@example.com`:
mail user@example.com

# To send an email with the subject line `Hello!` to the address `user@example.com`:
mail -s "Hello!" user@example.com

# To send a carbon copy of the email to the address `other@example.com`:
mail -c other@example.com user@example.com

# To send a blind carbon copy of the email to the address `secret@example.com`:
mail -b secret@example.com user@example.com
```
