The usleep function in Linux suspends the calling thread for a specified number of microseconds.

The usecs argument is the number of microseconds to suspend the thread.

For example, the following code will suspend the calling thread for 100 microseconds:

```
#include <unistd.h>


int main() {
  usleep(100);
  return 0;
}
```

# help 

```

```
