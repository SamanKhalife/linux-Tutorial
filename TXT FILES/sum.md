The "sum" command in Linux is used to compute checksums for files. It calculates a simple checksum value, often referred to as the "checksum" or "checksum-1," which is used to verify the integrity of files.

# help 

```
Usage: sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print checksum and block counts for each FILE.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -r              use BSD sum algorithm, use 1K blocks
  -s, --sysv      use System V sum algorithm, use 512 bytes blocks
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

```
