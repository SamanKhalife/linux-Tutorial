The disable command in the cardctl command line utility disables a PCMCIA socket. This means that the socket will not be available for use by PCMCIA cards.

To disable a PCMCIA socket, you can use the following command:

`cardctl disable <socket_number>`

For example, to disable the first PCMCIA socket, you would use the following command:

`cardctl disable 0`

Here is an example of how to use the disable command:

```
# Disable the first PCMCIA socket
cardctl disable 0

# Check the status of the socket
cardctl status 0
```




# help 

```
disable [options] <socket_number>
