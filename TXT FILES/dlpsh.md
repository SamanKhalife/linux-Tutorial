The `dlpsh` command in Linux is used to connect to a Palm handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands. It is a powerful tool that can be used to manage Palm handhelds from the command line.

The `dlpsh` command is used in the following syntax:

```
dlpsh [options] device_name
```

The `device_name` is the name of the device that contains the Palm handheld that you want to connect to.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-u` : Specify the user name to use.
* `-p` : Specify the password to use.

For example, the following code will connect to the Palm handheld on the device `/dev/ttyUSB0` and execute the command `ls`:

```
dlpsh -u johndoe -p password /dev/ttyUSB0 ls
```

This code will connect to the Palm handheld on the device `/dev/ttyUSB0` and execute the command `ls`. The output of the command will be printed to the standard output.

The `dlpsh` command is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to manage Palm handhelds from the command line. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used by system administrators to manage Palm handhelds on a Linux system.
