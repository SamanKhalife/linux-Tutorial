# modinfo

The `modinfo` command in Linux is used to display information about kernel modules. Kernel modules are pieces of software that can be loaded into the Linux kernel to add new features or functionality.

The syntax of the `modinfo` command is as follows:

```
modinfo [options] module-name
```

The `module-name` argument specifies the name of the kernel module that you want to get information about.

The `options` argument specifies additional options for getting information about the kernel module. The most common options are as follows:

* `-F`: Display the value of a specific field.
* `-k`: Display the kernel version that the module was built for.
* `-n`: Display the name of the module.
* `-p`: Display the path to the module file.

For example, the following command displays the name, version, and description of the kernel module `module-name`:

```
modinfo module-name
```

The `modinfo` command is a useful tool for getting information about kernel modules. It can be used to see what kernel modules are loaded, to get information about a specific kernel module, or to troubleshoot kernel module problems.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `modinfo` command:

* The `modinfo` command can only be used to get information about kernel modules that are loaded into the Linux kernel.
* The `modinfo` command cannot be used to get information about kernel modules that are not loaded into the Linux kernel.
* The `modinfo` command can be used to get information about kernel modules that are installed on your system, even if they are not currently loaded.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `modinfo` command, so that you do not get confused by the output or accidentally get information about a kernel module that is not relevant to your system.
