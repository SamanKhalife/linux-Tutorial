The cardctl command in Linux is used to monitor and control the state of PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) sockets. It can be used to see which sockets are available, to enable or disable sockets, and to eject PCMCIA cards.


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The options argument is a list of options that you can use to customize the output of the cardctl command.

The command argument is the command that you want to run. The possible commands are:

list: This command lists the available PCMCIA sockets.
status: This command shows the status of a PCMCIA socket.
enable: This command enables a PCMCIA socket.
disable: This command disables a PCMCIA socket.
eject: This command ejects a PCMCIA card.

For example, the following command will list the available PCMCIA sockets:

`cardctl list`

The following command will enable the first PCMCIA socket:

`cardctl enable 0`

The following command will eject the PCMCIA card in the first PCMCIA socket:

`cardctl eject 0`
