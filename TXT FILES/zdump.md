There is no such command as zdump in Linux. However, there is a command called gzip that can be used to compress files.

Here are some examples of how to use the gzip command:

To compress the file file.txt and output the compressed data to stdout:
`gzip -c file.txt`

To decompress the file file.txt.gz:
`gzip -d file.txt.gz`

To show help for the gzip command:
`gzip --help`

# help 

```
-c, --stdout: This option compresses the file and outputs the compressed data to stdout.
-d, --decompress: This option decompresses the file.
-h, --help: This option shows this help message.
```
