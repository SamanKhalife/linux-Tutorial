# unalias

The `unalias` command is used to remove an alias from the command line. The `unalias` command is used as follows:

```
unalias [alias]
```

* `alias`: This is the name of the alias to remove.

For example, to remove the alias `foo`, you would run the following command:

```
unalias foo
```

The `unalias` command only removes aliases. To define an alias, use the `alias` command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
