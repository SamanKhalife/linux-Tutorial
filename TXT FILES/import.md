There are two commands named "import" in Linux. One is a command-line tool for capturing screenshots, and the other is a command for importing modules into Bash and other Unix shells.

The `import` command for capturing screenshots is part of the ImageMagick suite of tools. It can be used to capture any visible window on an X server screen and save the image to a file.

The syntax for the `import` command for capturing screenshots is:

```
import [options] filename
```

The `options` that you can use with the `import` command for capturing screenshots include:

* `-window`: Specifies the window that you want to capture.
* `-frame`: Includes the window manager frame in the captured image.
* `-border`: Includes the window border in the captured image.
* `-quiet`: Suppresses all warning messages.
* `-monitor`: Monitors the progress of the screenshot capture.
* `-screen`: Selects the image from the root window.

The `import` command for importing modules into Bash and other Unix shells is a command-line tool that can be used to import modules from remote servers or from local files.

The syntax for the `import` command for importing modules is:

```
import [options] module_name
```

The `options` that you can use with the `import` command for importing modules include:

* `-u`: Imports the module as a user function.
* `-f`: Imports the module as a file.
* `-r`: Imports the module recursively.
* `-v`: Prints verbose output.
