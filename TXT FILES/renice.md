# renice

The `renice` command in Unix and Linux is used to alter the scheduling priority of running processes. It allows you to change the nice value of existing processes, thereby adjusting their priority relative to other processes on the system.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for `renice` is:

```sh
renice priority [-p] pid [...]
```

- **`priority`**: The new priority (nice value) to set for the process. Values range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).
- **`-p`**: Option to interpret the following arguments as process IDs (PIDs).
- **`pid`**: The process ID(s) of the process(es) you want to renice.

### Examples

#### Increase Priority (Lower Nice Value)

To increase the priority (lower nice value) of a process with PID 1234:

```sh
renice -n -10 -p 1234
```

- **`-n -10`**: Sets the nice value to -10, increasing the priority of the process with PID 1234.

#### Decrease Priority (Higher Nice Value)

To decrease the priority (higher nice value) of a process with PID 5678:

```sh
renice -n 10 -p 5678
```

- **`-n 10`**: Sets the nice value to 10, decreasing the priority of the process with PID 5678.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Resource Management**: Adjust process priorities to optimize system performance.
- **Batch Jobs**: Schedule CPU-intensive tasks to run with lower priority during peak times.
- **Process Tuning**: Fine-tune application performance by adjusting process priorities.

### Tips

- **Monitoring**: Use `top`, `ps`, or `htop` commands to monitor CPU usage and process priorities.
- **Permission Requirements**: Regular users can usually only decrease (increase nice value) their own processes' priorities. Root (superuser) can adjust priorities of any process.

### Summary

The `renice` command is crucial for dynamically adjusting process priorities in Unix and Linux environments. It provides flexibility in managing system resources by modifying the scheduling priority of running processes. Understanding how to use `renice` effectively enables better resource allocation and performance tuning on Unix-based systems.



# help 

```
Usage:
 renice [-n] <priority> [-p|--pid] <pid>...
 renice [-n] <priority>  -g|--pgrp <pgid>...
 renice [-n] <priority>  -u|--user <user>...

Alter the priority of running processes.

Options:
 -n, --priority <num>   specify the nice value
 -p, --pid              interpret arguments as process ID (default)
 -g, --pgrp             interpret arguments as process group ID
 -u, --user             interpret arguments as username or user ID

 -h, --help             display this help
 -V, --version          display version
