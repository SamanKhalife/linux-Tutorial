# ed

The `ed` command in Linux is a line-based text editor that is simple and easy to use. It is a popular choice for beginners because it is easy to learn and use.

The `ed` command is used in the following syntax:

```
ed [options] file_name
```

The `file_name` is the name of the file that you want to edit.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-s` : Start editing at the end of the file.
* `-w` : Write the file to disk after each change.
* `-r` : Read the file from disk before editing.

For example, the following code will edit the file `file.txt` starting at the end of the file:

```
ed -s file.txt
```

This code will open the file `file.txt` in edit mode, and start editing at the end of the file.

The `ed` command is a simple and easy-to-use text editor that is perfect for beginners. It is a powerful tool that can be used to edit files, but it is not as feature-rich as some other text editors, such as vi or vim.
