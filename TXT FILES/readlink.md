# raedlink

The `readlink` command in Linux is used to print the target of a symbolic link. This can be useful to determine the actual file or directory that a symbolic link points to.

The `readlink` command is used in the following syntax:

```
readlink [options] [symlink]
```

The `symlink` is the symbolic link to print the target of.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-f` : Follow symbolic links recursively.
* `-n` : Print the target of the symbolic link without trailing slashes.

For example, to print the target of the symbolic link `mylink`, you would run the following command:

```
readlink mylink
```

This command will print the target of the symbolic link `mylink`.

To follow symbolic links recursively and print the target of the last symbolic link, you would run the following command:

```
readlink -f mylink
```

This command will follow all symbolic links in the path of the symbolic link `mylink` and print the target of the last symbolic link.

To print the target of the symbolic link `mylink` without trailing slashes, you would run the following command:

```
readlink -n mylink
```

This command will print the target of the symbolic link `mylink` without trailing slashes.

The `readlink` command is a versatile tool that can be used to determine the target of a symbolic link. It is a simple command to use and is supported by most Linux distributions.
