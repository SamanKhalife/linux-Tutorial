# isosize

The `isosize` command in Linux is used to display the size of an ISO image file. It can be used to determine the size of an ISO image file before burning it to a disk or mounting it as a filesystem.

The `isosize` command takes the following arguments:

* `isofile`: The name of the ISO image file to display the size of.

For example, the following command displays the size of the ISO image file `myiso.iso`:

```
isosize myiso.iso
```

The `isosize` command is a useful tool for determining the size of ISO image files. It can be used to prevent errors when burning ISO image files to disks or mounting them as filesystems.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `isosize` command:

* The `isosize` command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to read the ISO image file.
* The `isosize` command can only be used to display the size of ISO image files that are located on the local machine.
* The `isosize` command cannot be used to display the size of ISO image files that are located on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `isosize` command, so that you do not accidentally display the size of an ISO image file that you do not have permission to read or that is located on a remote machine.

Here are some examples of how to use the `isosize` command:

* To display the size of the ISO image file `myiso.iso`:
```
isosize myiso.iso
```
* To display the size of the ISO image file `myiso.iso` in human-readable format:
```
isosize -h myiso.iso
```
* To display the size of the ISO image file `myiso.iso` in bytes:
```
isosize -b myiso.iso
```
