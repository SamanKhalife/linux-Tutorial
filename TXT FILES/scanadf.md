The `scanadf` command in Linux is used to scan documents and images using an ADF (automatic document feeder). It is a versatile command that can be used to scan documents to a variety of formats, including PDF, TIFF, and PNG.

The `scanadf` command is used in the following syntax:

```
scanadf [options]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-d`: Specifies the device to scan.
* `-l`: Lists the available devices.
* `-m`: Specifies the mode to scan in.
* `-t`: Specifies the type of document to scan.

* `-h`: Displays help.

For example, to scan a document to a PDF file using the ADF, you would use the following command:

```
scanadf -d scanner -m color -t flatbed -o output.pdf
```

This command will scan the document in color mode, using the flatbed scanner, and save the output to the file `output.pdf`.
