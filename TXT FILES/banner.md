# banner

The `banner` command in Linux is used to print a large ASCII banner to the terminal. This can be useful for creating decorative banners or for displaying information in a large format.

The `banner` command is used in the following syntax:

```
banner [options] [text]
```

The `text` is the text that you want to print as a banner.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-w` : Set the width of the banner.
* `-h` : Set the height of the banner.
* `-f` : Set the font to use.
* `-d` : Disable the decorative borders.

For example, to print a banner that is 80 characters wide and 20 characters high, you would run the following command:

```
banner -w 80 -h 20 "Welcome to my website!"
```

This command will print the banner "Welcome to my website!" in an 80 by 20 character box.

To disable the decorative borders, you would run the following command:

```
banner -w 80 -h 20 -d "Welcome to my website!"
```

This command will print the banner "Welcome to my website!" without the decorative borders.

The `banner` command is a versatile tool that can be used to create decorative banners or to display information in a large format. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to create banners in a variety of sizes and fonts.

Here are some additional things to note about the `banner` command:
