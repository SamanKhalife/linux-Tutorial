In the context of Linux systems, "zic" stands for "zone information compiler." It is a command-line utility used to compile time zone data in the form of textual descriptions into a binary format that can be used by various software applications and libraries.

The time zone data is stored in a specific format defined by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) Time Zone Database. This database contains information about different time zones, their offsets from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), daylight saving time rules, historical changes, and more.

The zic command reads the time zone data files, typically found in the "/usr/share/zoneinfo" directory, and compiles them into a binary file format understood by the system. This binary data is then used by applications and services to correctly handle time zone conversions and adjustments.

In summary, zic is a Linux command-line utility used to compile time zone data into a binary format for efficient handling of time zone conversions and adjustments by software applications.
