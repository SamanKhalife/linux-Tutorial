The `diff` command in Linux is used to compare two files or directories and show the differences between them. It is a powerful tool that can be used to find differences between files, to check for changes in files, and to merge changes from one file into another.

The `diff` command is used in the following syntax:

```
diff [options] file1 file2
```

The `file1` and `file2` are the names of the files that you want to compare.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-b` : Ignore blank lines.
* `-c` : Show the context of the differences.
* `-u` : Show unified diff.
* `-I` : Ignore lines that match the regular expression.

For example, the following code will compare the files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and show the differences between them:

```
diff file1.txt file2.txt
```

This code will print the differences between the files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to the standard output.

The `diff` command is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to find differences between files, to check for changes in files, and to merge changes from one file into another. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used by system administrators and developers to manage files and directories.
