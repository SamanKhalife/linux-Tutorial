The `fgrep` command in Linux is a fast version of the `grep` command. It is used to search for a pattern in a file, but it does not read the entire file into memory. This makes it faster than `grep`, especially for large files.

The `fgrep` command is used in the following syntax:

```
fgrep [options] pattern file_name
```

The `pattern` is the string that you want to search for. The `file_name` is the name of the file that you want to search.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-c`: Counts the number of matches.
* `-i`: Ignores case.
* `-v`: Invert the match.
* `-n`: Prints the line number of each match.

For example, the following command searches for the pattern "hello" in the file `file.txt`:

```
fgrep hello file.txt
```

This command will search for the pattern "hello" in the file `file.txt` and print any lines that contain the pattern.

The `fgrep` command is a fast and efficient way to search for a pattern in a file. It is a valuable command to know, especially if you need to search large files.

Here are some additional things to note about the `fgrep` command:

* The `fgrep` command is faster than the `grep` command for large files.
* The `fgrep` command does not read the entire file into memory.
* The `fgrep` command is a simple and easy-to-use command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
