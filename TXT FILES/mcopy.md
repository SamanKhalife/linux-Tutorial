# mcopy

The `mcopy` command in Linux is used to copy files between MS-DOS and Unix file systems. It can be used to copy files between floppy disks, hard drives, or other storage devices.

The `mcopy` command takes the following arguments:

* `source`: The file or directory to copy from.
* `destination`: The file or directory to copy to.
* `options`: Optional arguments that control the behavior of the `mcopy` command.

The following are some of the most common options for the `mcopy` command:

* `-i`: Prompts for confirmation before overwriting existing files.
* `-s`: Copies recursively.
* `-t`: Converts line breaks from Unix to MS-DOS.
* `-u`: Copies only files that are newer or larger than the destination file.

For example, the following command copies the file `myfile.txt` from the floppy disk to the directory `/home/user`:

```
mcopy a:myfile.txt /home/user
```

The `mcopy` command is a useful tool for transferring files between MS-DOS and Unix file systems. It can be used to copy files between different types of media, or to copy files between different computers.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `mcopy` command:

* The `mcopy` command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to access the source and destination files.
* The `mcopy` command can only be used to copy files that are located on the local machine.
* The `mcopy` command cannot be used to copy files that are located on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `mcopy` command, so that you do not accidentally copy a file that you do not have permission to copy or that is located on a remote machine.

Here are some examples of how to use the `mcopy` command:

* To copy the file `myfile.txt` from the floppy disk to the directory `/home/user`:
```
mcopy a:myfile.txt /home/user
```
* To copy the file `myfile.txt` from the floppy disk to the directory `/home/user` recursively:
```
mcopy -s a:myfile.txt /home/user
```
* To copy the file `myfile.txt` from the floppy disk to the directory `/home/user` and convert line breaks to MS-DOS:
```
mcopy -t a:myfile.txt /home/user
```
* To copy only the file `myfile.txt` from the floppy disk to the directory `/home/user` if it is newer or larger than the destination file:
```
mcopy -u a:myfile.txt /home/user
```
