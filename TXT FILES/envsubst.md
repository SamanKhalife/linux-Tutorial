The `envsubst` command in Linux is used to substitute environment variables in text. It is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks and to make scripts more portable.

The `envsubst` command is used in the following syntax:

```
envsubst [options] [template]
```

The `template` is the text that you want to substitute environment variables in.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-i` : Replace all occurrences of environment variables.
* `-f` : Specify a file that contains environment variables.
* `-s` : Strip whitespace from the output.

For example, the following code will substitute the environment variable `HOME` in the text `This is my $HOME directory`:

```
envsubst -i 'HOME=$HOME' 'This is my $HOME directory'
```

This code will substitute the environment variable `HOME` with the value of the `HOME` variable, which is the user's home directory. The output of the command will be `This is my /home/user directory`.

The `envsubst` command is a powerful tool that can be used to substitute environment variables in text. It is a valuable tool to know, especially if you automate tasks or write scripts.
