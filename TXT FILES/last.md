The `last` command in Linux is used to display the most recent logins on the system. The `last` command is a useful tool for troubleshooting login problems, or for simply seeing who has logged into the system recently.

The syntax for the `last` command is as follows:

```

```

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `last` command.

Here are some of the most useful `last` options:

last -n 10
```

This command will display the last 10 logins on the system.
