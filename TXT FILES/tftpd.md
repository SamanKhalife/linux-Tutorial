# tftpd

The `tftpd` command is a command-line utility that can be used to create a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP is a simple protocol that can be used to transfer files between computers over a network.

The `tftpd` command is used as follows:

```
tftpd [options]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `tftpd` command.

For example, the following command will create a TFTP server on port 69:

```
tftpd -p 69
```

The `tftpd` command will listen on port 69 for incoming TFTP requests. When a request is received, the `tftpd` command will transfer the requested file to the client.

The `tftpd` command can be used to transfer files to and from remote computers. It can also be used to boot computers from a network image.

Here are some of the benefits of using `tftpd`:

* It is a simple and easy-to-use command.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.
* It is available as a free and open-source software.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `tftpd`:

* It is not secure.
* It can be difficult to troubleshoot if there are problems with the `tftpd` command.
* It may not be as effective as some other methods of transferring files or booting computers.

It is important to note that the `tftpd` command is not secure. It sends all data, including passwords, in plain text. This means that anyone who can sniff your network traffic can see your passwords and other sensitive information. If you need to transfer files or boot computers securely, you should use a different protocol, such as FTPS or NFS.
