The `nm` command in Linux is used to list the symbols in a file. It is a powerful command that can be used to troubleshoot problems with shared libraries, and to learn more about the symbols in a file.

The syntax of the `nm` command is as follows:

```
nm [options] file
```

The `file` argument specifies the file that you want to list the symbols for.

The `options` argument controls the behavior of the `nm` command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-a`: Lists all symbols, including undefined symbols.
* `-g`: Lists only global symbols.
* `-l`: Lists only local symbols.
* `-p`: Lists only the symbols that are defined in the file.
* `-u`: Lists only the undefined symbols.

For example, the following command lists all the symbols in the file `libstdc++.so.6`:

```
nm -a libstdc++.so.6
```

This command will list all the symbols in the file `libstdc++.so.6`, including undefined symbols.

The following command lists only the global symbols in the file `libstdc++.so.6`:

```
nm -g libstdc++.so.6
```

This command will list only the global symbols in the file `libstdc++.so.6`.

The `nm` command is a powerful command that can be used to list the symbols in a file.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `nm` command:

* It can be used to troubleshoot problems with shared libraries.
* It can be used to learn more about the symbols in a file.
* It can be used to identify the functions that are used by a program.

If you need to troubleshoot problems with shared libraries, or if you need to learn more about the symbols in a file, you should make sure to learn how to use the `nm` command. It is a valuable tool for working with shared libraries and for troubleshooting problems with programs.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `nm` command:

* You can use the `nm` command to list the symbols in any type of file, including executable files, shared libraries, and object files.
* The `nm` command can be used to list the symbols in files that are stored in compressed formats, such as gzip and bzip2.
* The `nm` command can be used to list the symbols in files that are stored in multiple formats, such as ELF and PE.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `nm` command, so that you do not get confused by the output.
