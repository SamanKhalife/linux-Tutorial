dstat is a system monitoring tool that can be used to collect and display real-time statistics about the performance of a Linux system. It can be used to monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and other metrics.

dstat is a powerful tool that can be used to troubleshoot performance problems and to identify bottlenecks. It is also a valuable tool for system administrators who need to monitor the performance of their systems.

Here are some of the most commonly used dstat statistics:

cpu: This statistic shows the CPU usage of each CPU core.

mem: This statistic shows the memory usage of the system.

disk: This statistic shows the disk I/O activity of the system.

net: This statistic shows the network traffic activity of the system.
