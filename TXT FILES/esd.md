# esd  

ESD stands for Enlightened Sound Daemon. It is a sound server for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It provides a sound API that can be used by applications to play audio. ESD is also a mixer, which means that it can be used to control the volume of different audio streams.

ESD is not a command-line tool. It is a daemon that runs in the background and provides a sound API to applications. To use ESD, you need to configure your applications to use it.

If you are looking for a command-line tool to play audio on Linux, you can use `mpg123` or `mplayer`. These tools can play audio files from the command line and do not require ESD.

Here are some additional things to note about ESD:

* ESD is a sound server.
* ESD provides a sound API to applications.
* ESD is a mixer.
* ESD is not a command-line tool.
* You can use `mpg123` or `mplayer` to play audio on Linux without ESD.
