# iotop

The `iotop` command in Linux is a monitoring tool that can be used to display the I/O (input/output) usage of processes and threads. It is a top-like utility that displays a table of current I/O usage by processes or threads on the Linux system.

The syntax of the `iotop` command is as follows:

```
iotop [options]
```

The `options` argument controls the behavior of the `iotop` command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-a`: Display all processes and threads, even those that are not doing I/O.
* `-b`: Display I/O in blocks instead of bytes.
* `-d`: Delay between updates, in seconds.
* `-n`: Number of updates to display, then exit.
* `-p`: PID of the process to monitor.
* `-u`: Username to monitor.
* `-c`: Display cumulative I/O instead of bandwidth.

For example, the following command will display the I/O usage of all processes and threads:

```
iotop
```

This command will display all processes and threads on the system, including their I/O usage.

The `iotop` command is a useful tool for troubleshooting I/O problems. It can be used to see which processes are consuming the most I/O resources and to identify processes that are causing bottlenecks.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `iotop` command:

* The `iotop` command requires root privileges to run.
* The `iotop` command can be used to monitor I/O on both physical and virtual disks.
* The `iotop` command can be used to monitor I/O on both local and remote systems.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `iotop` command, so that you do not accidentally monitor processes or systems that you do not have permission to monitor.
