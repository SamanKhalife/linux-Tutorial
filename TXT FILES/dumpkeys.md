The `dumpkeys` command in Linux is used to dump the keyboard translation tables. It writes to the standard output, the current contents of the keyboard driver's translation tables, in the format specified by Keymaps.

The `dumpkeys` command is used in the following syntax:

```
dumpkeys [options]
```

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-t` : Print only the function key string definitions.
* `-k` : Print only the key bindings.
* `-d` : Print only the compose key combinations.
* `-c` : Specify the character set to use.
* `-s` : Print short information.
* `-l` : Print long information.
* `-n` : Print in hexadecimal format.

For example, the following code will dump the keyboard translation tables and print only the function key string definitions:

```
dumpkeys -t
```

This code will print the function key string definitions to the standard output.

The `dumpkeys` command is a useful tool for debugging keyboard problems. It can also be used to create custom keyboard layouts.

Here are some additional things to note about the `dumpkeys` command:

* The `dumpkeys` command can be used to dump the keyboard translation tables for any keyboard layout.
* The `dumpkeys` command can be used to create custom keyboard layouts.
* The `dumpkeys` command is a simple and easy-to-use command.
