mv tool is used to move a file or a directory. This tool copies the files/files from the source to the specified destination and after each file copy is completed, the file is completely deleted. Of course, this tool is also used to rename a file or directory.

The syntax is that the first argument of this command is the path of the source file or directory, and then the second argument is the destination. 

	root@Saman:~# mv source  dest

	moving a file 

	root@Saman:~# mv test /tmp/bar 

	or moving sevral files

	root@Saman:~# mv  test1 test2 test3 test4 /tmp/bar  

	if yo want to move a dir (you need to use -r)

	root@Saman:~# mv -r /foo/  /tmp/

       The  backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the
       --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
