# fc-cache

The `fc-cache` command in Linux is used to build font information cache files for applications that use fontconfig for their font handling. It scans the font directories on your system and builds a cache file that contains information about the fonts that are available. This cache file is then used by applications to quickly look up information about fonts, such as their names, sizes, and encodings.

The `fc-cache` command is used in the following syntax:

```
fc-cache [options]
```

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-r` : Force the cache rebuild.
* `-s` : Only scan system-wide directories.
* `-v` : Verbose output.

For example, the following code will rebuild the font cache and only scan the system-wide directories:

```
fc-cache -r -s
```

This code will rebuild the font cache and only scan the directories that are specified in the `/etc/fonts/conf.d` directory.

The `fc-cache` command is a useful tool for improving the performance of applications that use fontconfig for their font handling. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used by system administrators to manage font caches on a Linux system.

Here are some additional things to note about the `fc-cache` command:

* The `fc-cache` command can be used to rebuild the font cache on demand.
* The `fc-cache` command can be used to scan specific directories for fonts.
