# wall 

The wall command in Linux is used to broadcast a message to all users who are logged into the system. The message is displayed in the terminal of each user.

For example, the following command will broadcast the message "This is a test message" to all users:

`wall This is a test message`

The wall command is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate with other users on your system. It can be used to announce important information, such as system outages or security alerts.

-n, --no-newline     Do not add a newline character to the end of the message.
-t, --timeout=SECONDS   Display the message for the specified number of seconds.
