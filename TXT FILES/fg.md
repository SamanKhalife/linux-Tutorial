# fg

The `fg` command in Linux is used to bring a stopped or background job to the foreground. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to resume a job that you have paused or put in the background.

The `fg` command is used in the following syntax:

```
fg [job_id]
```

The `job_id` is the ID of the job that you want to bring to the foreground. You can find the job ID by using the `jobs` command.

For example, the following code will bring the job with the ID 1 to the foreground:

```
fg 1
```

This code will bring the job with the ID 1 to the foreground and resume it.

The `fg` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to resume paused or background jobs. It is a valuable tool to know, especially if you frequently use the `jobs` command.

Here are some additional things to note about the `fg` command:

* The `fg` command can be used to bring any job to the foreground.
* The `fg` command can be used to resume paused jobs.
* The `fg` command can be used to resume background jobs.
* The `fg` command can be used to prioritize jobs.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
