**elvtune** is a tool used to tune the performance of ELF binaries in Linux. It provides the following features:

* **Splitting:** elvtune can split a binary into multiple smaller executable files. This can help to reduce the binary's memory footprint and improve its speed.
* **Compression:** elvtune can compress the data in a binary. This can help to reduce the binary's size and improve its speed.
* **Load time optimization:** elvtune can optimize the load time of a binary. This can help the binary to start up faster.
* **Execution time optimization:** elvtune can optimize the execution time of a binary. This can help the binary to run faster.

elvtune is provided as part of the Linux kernel. To use it, run the `elvtune` command. The `elvtune` command takes the following parameters:

* `-f`: Specifies the name of the binary.
* `-o`: Specifies the name of the output file.
* `-c`: Specifies whether to compress the binary.
* `-d`: Specifies whether to split the binary.
* `-l`: Specifies whether to optimize the load time of the binary.
* `-t`: Specifies whether to optimize the execution time of the binary.

For example, the following command splits the `file.elf` binary into the `file.out` file and compresses it:

```
elvtune -f file.elf -o file.out -c -d
```

elvtune is a useful tool for tuning the performance of binaries. However, it is important to understand how binaries work before using elvtune. If elvtune is used incorrectly, it can degrade the performance of binaries.
