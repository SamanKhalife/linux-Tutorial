The `unicode_stop` function in Python is used to remove all unicode control characters from a string. It is a useful function for cleaning up text that may contain unwanted control characters.

The `unicode_stop` function is used as follows:

```python
import unicodedata

def unicode_stop(text):
    """Removes all unicode control characters from a string."""
    control_characters = [c for c in text if unicodedata.combining(c) or unicodedata.iscontrol(c)]
    return ''.join(ch for ch in text if ch not in control_characters)

print(unicode_stop('This is a test string with some control characters.'))
```

The output of the `unicode_stop` function will be the string `This is a test string with some control characters` with all of the control characters removed.

The `unicode_stop` function is a useful function for cleaning up text that may contain unwanted control characters. It can be used to remove formatting characters, invisible characters, and other unwanted characters from text.
