# yppush

The `yppush` command is a command-line utility that can be used to push changes to NIS (Network Information Service) maps to slave servers. NIS is a service that provides a central repository for user and group information.

The `yppush` command is used as follows:

```
yppush [options] [map name] [source server] [destination server]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `yppush` command.
* `map name`: This is the name of the NIS map that you want to push.
* `source server`: This is the name of the NIS server that contains the updated map.
* `destination server`: This is the name of the NIS server that you want to push the map to.

For example, the following command pushes the changes to the `passwd` map from the source server `master` to the destination server `slave`:

```
yppush -m passwd master slave
```

The `yppush` command is a useful tool for system administrators who need to keep NIS maps synchronized between servers. It is also a useful tool for users who want to make sure that their local NIS maps are up to date.

Here are some of the benefits of using `yppush`:

* It is a simple and easy-to-use command.
* It can be used to push changes to NIS maps between servers of different platforms.
* It is reliable and efficient.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `yppush`:

* It can be slow for large NIS maps.
* It can be difficult to troubleshoot if there are problems with the push.
* It may not be as secure as some other methods of pushing NIS maps.
