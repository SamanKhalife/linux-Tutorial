In Linux, a built-in command is a command that is implemented in the shell itself. This means that the command does not need to be executed by a separate program. Built-in commands are typically faster than external commands, and they are often more secure.

Some examples of built-in commands in Linux include:

* `cd` : Change directory
* `pwd` : Print working directory
* `ls` : List files
* `echo` : Print text
* `exit` : Quit the shell

To see a list of all built-in commands in Linux, you can run the following command:

```
help
```

This command will print a list of all built-in commands, along with a brief description of each command.

Built-in commands are a powerful tool that can be used to interact with the Linux system. They are often faster and more secure than external commands, and they are a good choice for basic tasks.

Here are some additional things to note about built-in commands:

* Built-in commands are not available in all shells.
* Built-in commands are typically case-insensitive.
* Built-in commands can be used to control the shell itself.
* Built-in commands can be used to access the Linux kernel.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
