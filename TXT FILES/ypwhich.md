# ypwhich

The `ypwhich` command is a command-line utility that can be used to find the NIS (Network Information Service) server for a particular map. NIS is a service that provides a central repository for user and group information.

The `ypwhich` command is used as follows:

```
ypwhich [map name]
```

* `map name`: This is the name of the NIS map.

For example, the following command will find the NIS server for the map `passwd`:

```
ypwhich passwd
```

The output of the `ypwhich` command will be the name of the NIS server that is authoritative for the map. If the map is not found, the output of the command will be `not found`.

The `ypwhich` command is a valuable tool for system administrators who need to find the NIS server for a particular map. It is also a useful tool for users who want to know which NIS server their system is using.

Here are some of the benefits of using `ypwhich`:

* It is a simple and easy-to-use command.
* It can be used to find NIS servers for maps of different platforms.
* It is reliable and efficient.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `ypwhich`:

* It can be slow for large NIS maps.
* It can be difficult to troubleshoot if there are problems finding the NIS server.
* It is not as secure as some other methods of finding NIS servers.
