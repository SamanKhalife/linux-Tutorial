# telinit

Sure, the `telinit` command in Linux is used to change the system runlevel. The runlevel is a state in which the system is operating. There are 7 runlevels in Linux, each with its own purpose.

The `telinit` command is used as follows:

```
telinit [runlevel]
```

* `runlevel`: This is the runlevel that the system will be changed to. The default runlevel is 3.

The `telinit` command has a number of options that can be used to control the output of the command. Some of the most commonly used `telinit` options are:

* `-f`: This option specifies that the `telinit` command should ignore any errors that occur.
* `-q`: This option specifies that the `telinit` command should not display any output.

For example, the following command will change the system to runlevel 1:

```
telinit 1
```

The `telinit` command is a valuable tool for system administrators who need to change the system runlevel. It can be used to troubleshoot problems, to perform maintenance tasks, and to start and stop services.

Here is a table of the 7 runlevels in Linux and their purposes:

| Runlevel | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 0 | Halt the system |
| 1 | Single-user mode |
| 2 | Multiuser, no networking |
| 3 | Multiuser, with networking |
| 4 | Not used |
| 5 | Graphical login |
| 6 | Reboot the system |

The default runlevel is 3, which means that the system will boot into multiuser mode with networking. If you want to change the default runlevel, you can do so by editing the `/etc/inittab` file.
