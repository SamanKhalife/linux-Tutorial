The `lastlog` command in Linux is used to display the last login information for a specified user or all users. The `lastlog` command is a useful tool for troubleshooting login problems, or for simply seeing when a user last logged into the system.

The syntax for the `lastlog` command is as follows:

```
lastlog [options] user
```

The `user` argument is the username of the user whose last login information you want to display. If you do not specify a username, the `lastlog` command will display the last login information for all users.

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `lastlog` command.

Here are some of the most useful `lastlog` options:

* `-n`: Display the last `n` logins for the specified user.
* `-f`: Follow the last logins for the specified user in real time.
* `-s`: Display the system name of the last login for the specified user.
* `-t`: Display the time of the last login for the specified user.

Here is an example of how to use the `lastlog` command to display the last login information for the user `root`:

```
lastlog root
```

This command will display the last login information for the user `root`.

Here is an example of how to use the `lastlog` command to display the last 10 logins for the user `root`:

```
lastlog -n 10 root
```

This command will display the last 10 logins for the user `root`.

The `lastlog` command is a useful tool for troubleshooting login problems, or for simply seeing when a user last logged into the system. It can be used to see if there are any unauthorized logins, or to see if there are any logins that are failing.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `lastlog` command:
