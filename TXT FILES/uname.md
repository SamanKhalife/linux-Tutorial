The `uname` command in Linux is used to display information about the system, such as its name, version, architecture, and operating system.

The syntax for the `uname` command is as follows:

```
uname [options]
```

If no options are specified, the `uname` command will display the following information:

* The system's name
* The system's Linux kernel version
* The system's Linux kernel release

The following options can be used to display additional information:

* `-a`: This option displays all available information about the system.
* `-m`: This option displays the system's architecture.
* `-n`: This option displays the system's hostname.
* `-r`: This option displays the system's Linux kernel release.
* `-s`: This option displays the system's operating system.

The `uname` command is a valuable tool for system administrators and users who need to view information about the system. It can be used to troubleshoot problems, to identify the system's hardware and software, and to determine the system's compatibility with other systems.
