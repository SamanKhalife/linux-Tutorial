# makedbm


The makedbm command in Linux is used to create a NIS (Network Information Service) map. NIS maps are used to store information about users, groups, and hosts.

The syntax for the makedbm command is as follows:

```
makedbm [options] mapfile inputfile
```

The `mapfile` argument specifies the name of the NIS map to create.

The `inputfile` argument specifies the file that contains the data for the NIS map.

The `options` argument specifies additional options for the makedbm command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-d`: Specifies the directory to store the NIS map.
* `-f`: Force the creation of the NIS map, even if it already exists.
* `-k`: Specifies the key field for the NIS map.

For example, the following command creates a NIS map called `passwd` in the directory `/etc/yp` from the file `/etc/passwd`:

```
makedbm -d /etc/yp passwd /etc/passwd
```

The makedbm command is a useful tool for managing NIS maps. It can be used to create new NIS maps, to update existing NIS maps, or to delete NIS maps.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the makedbm command:

* The makedbm command must be run as root or by a user who has permission to manage NIS maps.
* The makedbm command can only be used to create NIS maps that are located on the local machine.
* The makedbm command cannot be used to create NIS maps that are located on a remote machine.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the makedbm command, so that you do not accidentally create a NIS map that is not accessible to other users or that is located on a remote machine.

Here are some examples of how to use the makedbm command:

* To create a NIS map called `passwd` in the directory `/etc/yp` from the file `/etc/passwd`:
```
makedbm -d /etc/yp passwd /etc/passwd
```
* To update an existing NIS map called `passwd` with the data in the file `/etc/newpasswd`:
```
makedbm -f passwd /etc/newpasswd
```
* To delete a NIS map called `passwd`:
```
makedbm -d /etc/yp -k passwd
```
