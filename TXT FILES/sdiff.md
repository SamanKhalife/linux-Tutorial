The `sdiff` command in Linux is a side-by-side diff tool. It is a versatile command that can be used to compare two text files, line by line.

The `sdiff` command is used in the following syntax:

```
sdiff [options] [file1] [file2]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-e`: Displays the differences in the files in a graphical format.
* `-u`: Displays the differences in the files in a unified format.
* `-n`: Suppresses the output of the first file.
* `-h`: Displays help.

The `file1` is the first file that is to be compared.

The `file2` is the second file that is to be compared.

For example, to compare the files `myfile1.txt` and `myfile2.txt`, you would use the following command:

```
sdiff myfile1.txt myfile2.txt
```

This command will compare the two files line by line and display the differences in the files.
