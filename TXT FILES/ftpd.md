The ftpd command in Linux is a daemon that provides an FTP server. It allows users to connect to your computer and transfer files.

For example, the following command will start the ftpd daemon and listen on port 21:

`ftpd -p 21`

The ftpd command is a powerful tool that can be used to share files with other users. However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can be a security risk.
