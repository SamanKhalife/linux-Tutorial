The `setleds` command in Linux is used to control the LEDs on a keyboard or other device. It is a versatile command that can be used to turn on, off, or flash the LEDs.

The `setleds` command is used in the following syntax:

```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-l`: Turns on the LEDs.
* `-o`: Turns off the LEDs.
* `-f`: Flashes the LEDs.
* `-r`: Sets the rate of the LED flash.
* `-n`: Sets the number of times to flash the LEDs.

The `device` specifies the device that the LEDs are connected to.

For example, to turn on the NumLock LED on a keyboard, you would use the following command:

```
setleds -l numlock
```

To turn off the CapsLock LED, you would use the following command:

```
setleds -o capslock
```

To flash the ScrollLock LED, you would use the following command:

```

To set the rate of the ScrollLock LED flash to 2Hz, you would use the following command:

```
setleds -r 2 scrolllock
```

To set the number of times to flash the CapsLock LED to 5, you would use the following command:

```
setleds -n 5 capslock
```
