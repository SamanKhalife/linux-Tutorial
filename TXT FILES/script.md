# script

The `script` command in Linux is used to record the output of a terminal session. It is a versatile command that can be used to troubleshoot problems, learn from previous sessions, and create documentation.

The `script` command is used in the following syntax:

```
script [options] [file]
```

The `options` are as follows:

* `-a`: Appends the output to the file.
* `-t`: Timestamps the output.
* `-c`: Records the commands that are executed.
* `-e`: Executes commands in the session.
* `-h`: Displays help.

The `file` is the file that will be used to store the output of the session.

For example, to record the output of the current terminal session to the file `mysession.log`, you would use the following command:

```
script mysession.log
```

This command will record the output of the current terminal session to the file `mysession.log`. The output will be appended to the file if the file already exists.

The `script` command is a powerful tool that can be used to record terminal sessions. It is supported by most Linux distributions.

Here are some of the benefits of using `script`:

* It can be used to record terminal sessions.
