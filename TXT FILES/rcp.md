# rcp

The `rcp` command in Linux is used to copy files between hosts on a network. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to copy files between hosts without the need for a third-party tool.

The `rcp` command is used in the following syntax:

```
rcp [options] [source] [target]
```

The `source` is the file or directory to copy.

The `target` is the file or directory to copy the source to.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-r` : Recursively copy the source to the target.
* `-p` : Preserve the permissions of the source when copying to the target.
* `-t` : Transfer the file using TCP instead of UDP.

For example, to copy the file `/home/user/data/file.txt` to the file `/opt/data/file.txt` on the host `192.168.1.100`, you would run the following command:

```
rcp /home/user/data/file.txt 192.168.1.100:/opt/data/file.txt
```

This command will copy the file `/home/user/data/file.txt` to the file `/opt/data/file.txt` on the host `192.168.1.100`.

To recursively copy the directory `/home/user/data` to the directory `/opt/data` on the host `192.168.1.100`, you would run the following command:

```
rcp -r /home/user/data 192.168.1.100:/opt/data
```

This command will recursively copy the directory `/home/user/data` to the directory `/opt/data` on the host `192.168.1.100`.

To preserve the permissions of the file `/home/user/data/file.txt` when copying it to the file `/opt/data/file.txt` on the host `192.168.1.100`, you would run the following command:

```
rcp -p /home/user/data/file.txt 192.168.1.100:/opt/data/file.txt
```

This command will copy the file `/home/user/data/file.txt` to the file `/opt/data/file.txt` on the host `192.168.1.100`, preserving the permissions of the source file.

The `rcp` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to copy files between hosts on a network. It is a versatile command that can be used to copy files between hosts regardless of their operating system.

Here are some additional things to note about the `rcp` command:

* The `rcp` command can be used to copy files between hosts on any network, including local networks and remote networks.
* The `rcp` command can be used to copy files between hosts running any operating system, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
* The `rcp` command is a secure command that encrypts the data being transferred between hosts.
