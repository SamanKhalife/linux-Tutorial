# ptx

The `ptx` command in Linux is used to generate permuted indexes of words in one or more text files. A permuted index is a type of index that lists all the words in a text file in alphabetical order, with the words that appear in the same context grouped together.

The syntax for the `ptx` command is as follows:

```
ptx [options] [files]
```

The `options` argument can be used to control the output of the command.

Some of the most useful `ptx` options include:

* `-c`: Case-insensitive.
* `-f`: Follow links.
* `-i`: Ignore case.
* `-m`: Merge words that appear in the same context.
* `-n`: Number lines.

Here is an example of how to use the `ptx` command to generate a permuted index of the words in the file `/etc/passwd`:

```
ptx /etc/passwd
```

This command will generate a permuted index of the words in the file `/etc/passwd`. The index will be written to the standard output stream.

Here is an example of how to use the `ptx` command to generate a permuted index of the words in all the files in the current directory:

```
ptx *
```

This command will generate a permuted index of the words in all the files in the current directory. The index will be written to the standard output stream.

The `ptx` command is a useful tool for finding words that appear in the same context in a text file. It can be used to troubleshoot problems with text files, or to simply find words that are related to each other.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `ptx` command:

* It can be used to troubleshoot problems with text files.
* It can be used to find words that are related to each other.
* It can be used to generate indexes of text files.
* It can be used to analyze text files.

If you are working with text files, you should make sure to learn how to use the `ptx` command. It is a valuable tool for finding words that appear in the same context in a text file.

```
Usage: ptx [OPTION]... [INPUT]...   (without -G)
  or:  ptx -G [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Output a permuted index, including context, of the words in the input files.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -A, --auto-reference           output automatically generated references
  -G, --traditional              behave more like System V 'ptx'
  -F, --flag-truncation=STRING   use STRING for flagging line truncations.
                                 The default is '/'
  -M, --macro-name=STRING        macro name to use instead of 'xx'
  -O, --format=roff              generate output as roff directives
  -R, --right-side-refs          put references at right, not counted in -w
  -S, --sentence-regexp=REGEXP   for end of lines or end of sentences
  -T, --format=tex               generate output as TeX directives
  -W, --word-regexp=REGEXP       use REGEXP to match each keyword
  -b, --break-file=FILE          word break characters in this FILE
  -f, --ignore-case              fold lower case to upper case for sorting
  -g, --gap-size=NUMBER          gap size in columns between output fields
  -i, --ignore-file=FILE         read ignore word list from FILE
  -o, --only-file=FILE           read only word list from this FILE
  -r, --references               first field of each line is a reference
  -t, --typeset-mode               - not implemented -
  -w, --width=NUMBER             output width in columns, reference excluded
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

```
