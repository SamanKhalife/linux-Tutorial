# ispell

Ispell is a Unix-based spelling checker that supports most Western languages. It offers several interfaces, including a programmatic interface for use by editors such as Emacs.

Here are some of the things you can do with ispell:

* Check the spelling of a document
* Suggest corrections for misspelled words
* Add words to your personal dictionary
* Ignore words from your personal dictionary
* Use ispell from within Emacs

To use ispell, you can either run it from the command line or use it from within Emacs.

To run ispell from the command line, type the following command:

```
ispell document.txt
```

This will check the spelling of the document `document.txt` and print any errors to the standard output.

To use ispell from within Emacs, you can use the `M-x ispell` command. This will open a new buffer in Emacs that will display the current word being checked. You can then use the arrow keys to move to the next word, or you can press `RET` to accept the current word.

If ispell finds a misspelled word, it will offer one or more suggestions for the correct spelling. You can then use the arrow keys to move to the desired suggestion, or you can press `RET` to accept the first suggestion.

You can also add words to your personal dictionary using ispell. To do this, type the following command:

```
ispell -a word
```

This will add the word `word` to your personal dictionary.

You can also ignore words from your personal dictionary using ispell. To do this, type the following command:

```
ispell -i word
```

This will ignore the word `word` in your personal dictionary.

Ispell is a powerful tool for checking the spelling of your documents. It is easy to use and supports a wide range of languages.
