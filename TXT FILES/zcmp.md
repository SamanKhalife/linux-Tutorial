# zcmp        

There is no such command as zcmp in Linux. However, there is a command called cmp that can be used to compare two files.

Here are some examples of how to use the cmp command:

To compare the files file1.txt and file2.txt:
`cmp file1.txt file2.txt`

To compare the first 10 lines of the files file1.txt and file2.txt:
`cmp -l 10 file1.txt file2.txt`

To show help for the cmp command:
`cmp --help`


# help 

```
-b, --brief: This option suppresses all but the most significant differences.
-l, --lines: This option specifies the number of lines to compare.
-h, --help: This option shows this help message.
```
