# anacron

Anacron is a daemon that is used to run periodic jobs on Linux systems. It is similar to the cron daemon, but it is designed to run jobs that are not time-critical, such as backups and system maintenance tasks.

Anacron is started automatically when the system boots. It can be stopped and started using the following commands:

```
systemctl stop anacron
systemctl start anacron
```

The anacrontab file is divided into two sections:

- The jobs section lists the jobs that Anacron should run. Each job has a name, a command, and a frequency.
- The days section lists the days of the week on which Anacron should run jobs.
