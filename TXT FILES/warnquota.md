The `warnquota` command is a command-line utility that can be used to send warning messages to users who are approaching their disk quota limits. It is a useful tool for system administrators who want to make sure that users do not exceed their disk quotas.

The `warnquota` command is used as follows:

```
warnquota [options] [filesystem] [user] [grace time]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `warnquota` command.
* `filesystem`: This is the name of the filesystem that the user is using.
* `user`: This is the username of the user that you want to send the warning message to.
* `grace time`: This is the amount of time in days that the user has before their quota is exceeded.

For example, the following command sends a warning message to the user `bob` if they are approaching their disk quota limit on the filesystem `/home`:

```
warnquota -g 30 /home bob
```

The `warnquota` command is a useful tool for system administrators who want to make sure that users do not exceed their disk quotas. It is also a useful tool for users who want to be aware of their disk usage.
