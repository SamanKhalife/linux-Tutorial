The `chrt` command in Linux can be used to change the scheduling policy of a process. The scheduling policy is the way that the processor time is allocated to a process.

To use the `chrt` command, you use the following syntax:

```
chrt [options] [policy] [priority] [pid]
```

* `policy` is the scheduling policy for the process.
* `priority` is the priority of the process.
* `pid` is the process ID.

`policy` has the following options:

* `BE` : Background priority
* `RT` : Real-time priority
* `FIFO` : First-in, first-out priority
* `RR` : Round-robin priority

`priority` can be a value from 0 to 99. The higher the value, the higher the priority of the process.

`pid` is the process ID. You can find the process ID using the `ps` command.

For example, to change the scheduling policy of the `firefox` process with PID 1234 to background priority, you would use the following command:

```
chrt -p BE 1234
```

To change the priority of the `firefox` process with PID 1234 to 10, you would use the following command:

```
chrt -p 10 1234
```

The `chrt` command can be used to change the scheduling policy of a process to improve the performance of the process.
