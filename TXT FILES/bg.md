The `bg` command in Linux is used to put a stopped job in the background. This allows you to continue working on other tasks while the job continues to run in the background.

The `bg` command is used in the following syntax:

```
bg [job_id]
```

The `job_id` is the ID of the job that you want to put in the background.

For example, to put the job with the ID 12345 in the background, you would run the following command:

```
bg 12345
```

This command will put the job with the ID 12345 in the background.

You can also use the `%` character as a placeholder for the job_id. For example, to put the most recently stopped job in the background, you would run the following command:

```
bg %
```

This command will put the most recently stopped job in the background.

The `bg` command is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to put stopped jobs in the background. It is a versatile command that can be used to put any job in the background, regardless of its type.
