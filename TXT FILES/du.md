Yes, the `du` command in Linux is used to display the disk usage of a directory.

Here is how to use it:

```
du [options] directory_name
```

For example, to display the disk usage of the current directory, you would run the following command:

```
du -sh
```

This command will display the disk usage of the current directory in a human-readable format.

You can also use the `-c` option to display the disk usage of an entire directory tree.

```
du -sch /
```

This command will display the disk usage of the root directory in a human-readable format.

The `du` command is useful for monitoring the disk usage of your file system and for identifying directories that are running low on disk space.
