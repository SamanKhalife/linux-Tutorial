# lpadmin

The `lpadmin` command in Linux is used to configure printers and printer classes provided by the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS). It can also be used to set the server default printer or class.

The syntax for the `lpadmin` command is as follows:

```
lpadmin [options] destination
```

The `destination` argument is the printer or class that you want to configure.

The `options` argument can be used to control the behavior of the `lpadmin` command.

Here are some of the most useful `lpadmin` options:

* `-p`: Configure a printer.
* `-c`: Configure a class.
* `-d`: Set the default printer or class.
* `-i`: Interactive mode.

Here is an example of how to configure a printer called `myprinter`:

```
lpadmin -p myprinter
```

This command will configure the printer `myprinter`. The printer will be added to the system, and it will be available for use.

Here is an example of how to configure a class called `myclass`:

```
lpadmin -c myclass
```

This command will configure the class `myclass`. The class will be added to the system, and it will be available for use.

Here is an example of how to set the default printer to `myprinter`:

```
lpadmin -d myprinter
```

This command will set the default printer to `myprinter`. All print jobs will be sent to the printer `myprinter` by default.
