The `rdev` command in Linux is used to change the root device of a Linux system. It is a powerful tool that can be used to change the boot device of a Linux system.

The `rdev` command is used in the following syntax:

```
rdev [options] [device]
```

The `device` is the device name of the new root device.

The `options` can be used to specify the following:

* `-f` : Force the change, even if the new root device is not bootable.
* `-v` : Be more verbose.

For example, to change the root device to the device `/dev/sda`, you would run the following command:

```
rdev -f /dev/sda
```

This command will change the root device to the device `/dev/sda`. If the device `/dev/sda` is not bootable, the system will not boot.

To be more verbose about the change, you would run the following command:

```
rdev -v -f /dev/sda
```

This command will change the root device to the device `/dev/sda` and print more information about the change.

The `rdev` command is a powerful tool that can be used to change the boot device of a Linux system. It is a versatile command that can be used to change the root device to any device that is supported by the Linux kernel.

Here are some additional things to note about the `rdev` command:

* The `rdev` command can be used to change the root device to any device that is supported by the Linux kernel.
* The `rdev` command can be used to change the root device to a device that is not bootable, but this can cause the system to not boot.
* The `rdev` command is a powerful tool that should be used with caution.
