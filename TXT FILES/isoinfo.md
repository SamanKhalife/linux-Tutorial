The `isoinfo` command in Linux is used to extract information from ISO 9660 images. ISO 9660 is a standard file system format for optical media, such as CDs and DVDs.

The syntax of the `isoinfo` command is as follows:

```
isoinfo [options] image
```

The `image` argument specifies the path to the ISO image file.

The `options` argument controls the behavior of the `isoinfo` command. The most common options are as follows:

* `-d`: Display the directory structure of the ISO image.
* `-t`: Display the table of contents of the ISO image.
* `-l`: Display the list of files in the ISO image.

For example, the following command will display the directory structure of the ISO image file `myimage.iso`:

```
isoinfo -d myimage.iso
```

This command will display the directory structure of the ISO image file `myimage.iso`.

The following command will display the table of contents of the ISO image file `myimage.iso`:

```
isoinfo -t myimage.iso
```

This command will display the table of contents of the ISO image file `myimage.iso`.

The `isoinfo` command is a useful command for troubleshooting ISO image files. It can be used to see if the ISO image file is corrupt, and to see what files are contained in the ISO image file.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `isoinfo` command:

* The `isoinfo` command can only be used to extract information from ISO 9660 images.
* The `isoinfo` command will not work with other types of image files, such as .img or .bin files.
* The `isoinfo` command can be used to extract files from ISO image files.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using the `isoinfo` command, so that you do not get confused by the output or accidentally extract files from the ISO image file.
