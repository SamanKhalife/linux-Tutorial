The `fmt` command in Linux is used to format text files. It is a simple and easy-to-use command that can be used to improve the readability of text files.

The `fmt` command is used in the following syntax:

```
fmt [options] file
```

The `file` is the file that you want to format.

The options can be used to specify the following:

* `-w` : Set the width of the output lines.
* `-s` : Squeeze multiple spaces into single spaces.
* `-t` : Use tabs instead of spaces.
* `-c` : Center the output.

For example, the following code will format the file `file.txt` to a width of 80 characters:

```
fmt -w 80 file.txt
```

This code will format the file `file.txt` to a width of 80 characters and output the formatted text to the standard output.
