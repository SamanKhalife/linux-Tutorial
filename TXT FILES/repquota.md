The `repquota` command in Linux is used to print the quota usage for each file system reported by the Quota Manager. This command is useful for maintaining the quota usage information used by the Quota Manager.

The `repquota` command is used in the following format:

```
repquota [options] [filesystem]
```

The `options` are:

* `-a` : Print quota usage for all filesystems.
* `-g` : Print quota usage for the specified group.
* `-u` : Print quota usage for the specified user.

The `filesystem` is the name of the filesystem to print quota usage for.

For example, to print quota usage for all filesystems, you would run the following command:

```
repquota -a
```

To print quota usage for the specified group, you would run the following command:

```
repquota -g <group name>
```

To print quota usage for the specified user, you would run the following command:

```
repquota -u <user name>
```
