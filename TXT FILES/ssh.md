# ssh

The `ssh` command is a command-line utility that can be used to connect to a remote computer over a secure network connection. It is a powerful tool that can be used to manage and administer remote systems, to transfer files, and to troubleshoot problems.

The `ssh` command is used as follows:

```
ssh [options] [user name]@[host name]
```

* `options`: These are optional flags that can be used to control the behavior of the `ssh` command.
* `user name`: This is the name of the user account that you want to connect to on the remote computer.
* `host name`: This is the hostname or IP address of the remote computer that you want to connect to.

For example, the following command will connect to the remote computer with hostname `www.example.com` as the user `root`:

```
ssh root@www.example.com
```

The `ssh` command will prompt for the password of the user `root` on the remote computer. Once the password is entered, the `ssh` command will connect to the remote computer and you will be able to interact with it as if you were logged in locally.
