# routed

The `routed` command in Linux is a deprecated command that was used to configure and manage routing tables. Routing tables are used to determine the path that packets should take to reach their destination.

The `routed` command is no longer recommended for use. It is a legacy protocol that is not secure and can be spoofed by attackers. Instead, you should use the `ip` command to configure and manage routing tables.

The `ip` command is a powerful tool that can be used to do a variety of things with routing tables, including:

* Adding routes to the routing table.
* Removing routes from the routing table.
* Displaying the routing table.
* Troubleshooting routing problems.

The `ip` command is used in the following syntax:

```
ip [options] [command]
```

The `command` is the specific task that you want to perform on the routing table.

For example, to add a route to the routing table for the destination `192.168.1.0/24`, you would use the following command:

```
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.0.1
```

This command will add a route to the routing table for the destination `192.168.1.0/24` with the gateway `192.168.0.1`.

The `ip` command is a powerful tool that can be used to do a variety of things with routing tables. It is supported by most Linux distributions and is a versatile tool for managing your routing tables.

Here are some of the benefits of using `ip`:

* It is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to do a variety of things with routing tables.
* It is supported by most Linux distributions.
* It is a free and open-source software.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using `ip`:

* It can be difficult to use for complex tasks.
* It can be slow to add or remove routes from the routing table.
* It is not as secure as some other tools for managing routing tables.

The `ip` command is a powerful tool that can be used to do a variety of things with routing tables. It is supported by most Linux distributions and is a versatile tool for managing your routing tables.
