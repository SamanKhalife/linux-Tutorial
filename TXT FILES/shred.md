The shred command is a Linux command that can be used to securely delete files. It does this by overwriting the file data with random data, making it impossible to recover the original data.

Here are some examples of how to use the shred command:

```
# To securely delete the file `file.txt`:
shred file.txt

# To securely delete the file `file.txt` and overwrite it 3 times:
shred -n 3 file.txt

# To securely delete the file `file.txt` and force the overwrite, even if the file is open:
shred -f file.txt

# To securely delete the file `file.txt` and zero out the file data after overwriting it:
shred -z file.txt
```

The shred command is a powerful tool that can be used to securely delete files. It is a simple command to use, but it can be very effective.
